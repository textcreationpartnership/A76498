         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I do not go, nor ſend any up and down to wrangle, but to demand, (as is my duty) and to receive that temporal mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which of Right from Chriſt doth appertain unto me. If any will wran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I ſay, Thou cannot be ignorant, if thou be a Reader of Holy Scriptures, and not a Rejecter of them, that the <hi>Levites</hi> under the Law (of whom many were very holy men) received Tithes, and that God commanded the people to pay Tithes to them: and that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Know you not, that they who miniſter about the Holy things, eat of the things of the Temple, and they</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 13, 41.</note> 
                  <hi>which wait at the Altar, are partakers with the Altar:</hi> even ſo alſo, hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſhould live of the Goſpel: mind theſe words, <hi>Even ſo hath the Lord ordained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle tels us, that as it was ordained by God, that they of old, who waited on the Altar, ſhould live of the Altar: ſo God
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119173:9"/> hath ordained, that they who preach the Goſpel, would even ſo live of the Goſpel; even ſo, comprehends in it, that in the ſame manner, the maintenance of the Preachers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſhould ariſe, which thou may know was by Tithes and Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <note place="margin">Act. 4. 34.</note> by lands and houſes for them, and their family, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the practiſe of the Apoſtles and Diſciples, which thou calls for, to be ſhewed from plain Scripture, it was plainly thus: At the firſt, Believers who had poſſeſſions of Lands and houſes, ſold them, and brought the prices of them, and laid them down at the Apoſtles feet. The Apoſtles during that time, could not in equity demand Tithes from them, who had made over to them the poſſeſſion of what they had, from whence Tithes aroſe: and were content themſelves to receive their livelihood for the future, from ſuch diſtributions, which the Apoſtles allowed to every man, according as they had need.</p>
               <p>Now if thou or others thinks, that Miniſters ought exactly to conform to this firſt practiſe of the Apoſtles in not receiving Tithes, becauſe they had mens whole poſſeſſions (whence aroſe Tithes) committed to their prudent diſpoſal: then thou, and thoſe others, who call your ſelves Believers, ought in equity to commit to the Miniſters your whole Eſtates, to be prudentially diſpoſed of by them to every man, as they have need, or elſe you conform not to theſe Believers, who lived in the Apoſtles dayes, and inabled them to live without demanding and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tithes. But we the faithfull Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, do require no ſuch thing to be done to us by you, as was done to the Apoſtles by the firſt Believers. Neither is their any neceſſity for you, to imitate thoſe firſt Believers in their giving up all to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, or for us Miniſters to receive from you all that which you have: becauſe the Apoſtle hath exactly preſcribed, that the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Miniſters, ſhould ariſe in anothe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Another practiſe therefore of the Apoſtles, was plainly this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In places where Churches was planted, and the cuſtome of ſelling lands and houſes, and conferring them upon Miniſters, was not obſerved: the Apoſtles themſelves expected, and took alſo maintenance from thoſe, among whom they had laboured; except ſome grand inconveniences would have enſued, upon <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 7, 8.</note> their taking maintenance. The Apoſtle tels the <hi>Corinthians, I have preached unto you the Goſpel freely, I robbed other</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:119173:9"/> 
                  <hi>Churches, taking wages of them to do you ſervice.</hi> He here plainly ſhews, that the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> where he had laboured, was bound to have afforded unto him, a livelihood and maintenance: and that they had been very faulty in not doing ſo; and that while he did them ſervice, he had received from other Churches maintenance, accounting it a kind of robbing thoſe Churches, to take from them any thing for that ſervice which was by him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded to another Church, and at that time, not to them: for the Apoſtle knew, that every Church (where the Goſpel was preached) was bound to afford, a ſufficient and honourable maintenance to their Teachers; and that would ſeem a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction from, and obſtruction of that ſufficiency of <hi>Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> for their own peculiar Teachers; if the Teachers of other Churches ſhould for their Relief and <hi>maintenance,</hi> while they ſerve thoſe other Churches, depend on them to receive it. Yea, the Apoſtle askes the <hi>Corinthians</hi> forgiveneſs for this wrong, in <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12 13</note> not being burdenſom to them, by taking <hi>maintenance</hi> from them, which they ought to have paid: Thereby ſhewing plainly,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he was not bound to abſtain, from receiving from them, though he was pleaſed to do it for preventing falſe conſtructions, which falſe Teachers, and his, and the Miniſters enemies would have made of it: as if he were a ſelf-ſeeker, a covetous wretch, an oppreſſor, a Fleecer and Spoiler of his flock, and a partial Judge in his own cauſe: even as thou, and ſuch as thou, ſeek with ſuch like expreſſions, to defame me, and other Miniſters, pleading for our juſt ſetled <hi>maintenance</hi> by Tythes; And</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle by the forementioned words, doth plainly intimate, that other Miniſters were not bound to forbear receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from people their own Rights, as he did forbear it among the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, This ſame Apoſtle hath laid down a Canon to be for ever obſerved; it is this, <hi>Let him that is taught in the Word,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 6.</note>

               <p>And for thy further information, know alſo that it is not to be found in the whole New Teſtament, that any Apoſtle, or that any Saint, or that the Saint of Saints, <hi>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> did ſpeak one word againſt Tithes, or forbid the paying of Tithes to them, who were the Miniſters of Gods ſervice. I am ſure that he hath ratified the Law of Tithes, and hath ſpoke for them. He tells us that he came not to <hi>deſtroy the Law,</hi> he means the moral Law: yea, he ratifies the eight Commandment, which forbids robbing of men, and robbing of God: a ſin which <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 8.</note> God doth moſt earneſtly complain of, and tells how he was rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, <hi>even in Tithes and Offerings.</hi> And again, our Saviout ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſces,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Wo to you Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,</hi>

                  <hi>Hypocrites, for ye tithe Mint and Rue, and all manner of herbs, and paſs over Judgement and the love of God, theſe things ought you to have done, and not leave the other undone.</hi> According to the Tenor of our Saviours own words, to take and pay tithes, is no other, but what ought to be done: the fault which he cryed woe againſt, <hi>was the neglect of Judgement, and the love of God.</hi>

               <p>But it is plain, that they who were guilty of that filthy lucre, whereof the Apoſtle did ſpeak, were Seducers, men who had crept into houſes, and there led Captive ſilly women, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the Truth, and ſubverted whole families: theſe men unallowed, and unlawfully, and diſorderly intruding into teaching in private houſes, were the men, whom the Apoſtle calls unruly and vain Talkers, and Deceivers: he tells us, that they t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus the Allowance only which Seducers received, and had from their ſeduced Diſciples, what ever it was (and not any <hi>maintenance</hi> of the publick Teachers of the Church) is branded by the Apoſtle with that ignominious term, <hi>of filthy lucre:</hi> and well he might ſo term it, ſeeing it was the recompence of thoſe filthy falſhoods which they had taught, but ought not: for all gain got from, or with the breach of any Law of God, is filthy lucre.</p>

He blames not the uppermoſt ſeats in feaſts, and chiefeſt ſeats in the Synagogues, bur their love and deſire, and proud choiſe, to ſit in theſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt ſeats at feaſts, and in the chiefeſt ſeats in the Synagogues. <note place="margin">Luk. 14. 7, 8, 9, 10.</note> He tells us, <hi>That the uppermoſt ſeats at feaſts, are to be reſerved, for the moſt honourable who are invited:</hi> and nature it ſelf will tell any, that it cannot be avoided, for order ſake, but that in all ſuch aſſemblies of reſort, as were the Synagogues, ſome muſt ſit uppermoſt; except the very place, and all the ſeats in it, be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether round, whereby the diſtinction of upper and lower rooms or ſeats are wholly abandoned.

               <p>But underſtand thou Chriſts words aright, and thou will alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that Miniſters and others may lawfully be called of men <hi>Maſters,</hi> when the word <hi>Maſter</hi> ſignifies another thing; then that, for which Chriſt is only called <hi>Maſter:</hi> and thou may alſo underſtand, that they who are called of men <hi>Maſters,</hi> do yet abide in the Doctrine of Chriſt; and that Chriſts word doth allow, and approve, that men may be called of other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. To clear this know, that the word <hi>Maſter</hi> hath ſeveral ſignifications.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It ſometimes ſignifies one who hath abſolute power and Authority, over every mans faith: by whoſe directions every one is to be guided and ordered in matters of faith, and of ſpiritual obedience. Thus Chriſt only is Maſter. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 8, 10. <hi>His word is a Law, and he guides his ſaved people by his Word and Spirit unto everlasting life.</hi> He in this ſenſe is the only Maſter whom all are to believe, and follow, and acknowledge, to be the abſolute Lord and Maſter of their faith according to what he <note place="margin">Joh. 12. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> ſaid, <hi>I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>None ought to arrogate to themſelves the title of <hi>Maſter</hi> in this ſenſe: which thing the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Scribes</hi> attempted to do: ſeeking ambitiouſly to be counted Head-maſters, or chief Leaders of the people, the only ſupereminent guiders of men, drawing Diſciples not to Chriſt, the only chief Maſter, but draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſciples after them, as if they were the only chief Maſters: Chriſt reproves this ſin, and bids his Diſciples not to be called of men <hi>Masters</hi> in this ſenſe, becauſe they have but one Maſter in heaven Chriſt, and they are brethren, to wit, in that ſame faith, which he hath delivered to the Saints.</p>
               <p>Be it then known unto thee, that neither I, nor any faithfull Miniſter of Chriſt in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> dare aſſume unto our ſelves the name of Maſter in this ſenſe: neither do we
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119173:13"/> think, that any pious Believer is ſo ill principled, as to call any of us Maſter upon that account; if any do it, we take no pride, nor pleaſure therein, as did the <hi>Phariſees:</hi> and if we knew that <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 24 Phil. 1 25.</note> any doth ſo, we would ſharply rebuke them; letting them know, that we have no dominion over their faith, but are helpers of their joy, and that we abide and continue with them all, only for their furtherance and joy of faith: and not as if we were Authors and Finiſhers of it, for ſo Chriſt is the only Maſter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The name <hi>Maſter</hi> ſignifies one, who under Chriſt, is a ſubordinate Teacher and Opener unto others, the Counſel of God revealed: ſuch an one (by reaſon of his office) is called, <hi>a Maſter in Iſrael:</hi> thus Chriſt himſelf acknowledged, that <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi> was a Maſter: though his reproving demand ſhews that it <note place="margin">Joh, 3. 10.</note> is a ſhame for a profeſſed Teacher to be ignorant of a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal principle of faith. Thus alſo <hi>Paul</hi> called himſelf a wiſe Maſter-Builder under God, the chief Builder; and thus the <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 9, 10. Eccl. 12. 11</note> Paſtors and Teachers aſſembled in the ſervice of God, are called <hi>Maſters of the Aſſemblies.</hi> It is therefore no ſin in any Miniſter, to be called of men, <hi>A Maſter</hi> under Chriſt, teaching his people: neither doth he depart from Chriſts Doctrine, though men ſo call him, if he do not out of pride, and vain glory, affect to be called ſo: neither do men ſin who call any Miniſter a Maſter, in the ſenſe rehearſed, ſo they acknowledge that Chriſt is the chief Maſter Teacher, and that his Miniſters are only Maſters ſubordinate, and under him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The name <hi>Maſter</hi> ſignifies one, who hath authority over others: and thus every one, who hath a family, may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully count himſelf the Maſter thereof, and may be counted and called by theſe, <hi>Maſter,</hi> who are ſubject to him: and yet he abides ſtill in the Doctrine of Chriſt, though men call him in this ſenſe their <hi>Maſter.</hi> When the Centurion told Chriſt, I ſay to my ſervant, <hi>Do this, and he doth it:</hi> Chriſt doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove <note place="margin">Mat. 8. 9. 1 Tim. 6. 1, 2. Eph. 6. 5.</note> him, for counting himſelf the Maſter of ſervants: and the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let as many ſervants as are under the yoak, count their own Maſters worthy of all honour:</hi> and again, <hi>Servants be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to them who are your Maſters according to the fleſh.</hi> If others who are <hi>Maſters</hi> of a family, may (according to the Doctrine contained in the New Teſtament) be called of thoſe Maſters, who are their ſervants: then a <hi>Minister</hi> alſo, (who is a <hi>Maſter</hi> of a family, and is to rule well his houſe, having his Children and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119173:13"/> family too in ſubjection, with all gravity) may ſtill, and doth ſtill <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3, 4</note> abide in Chriſts Doctrine, though his ſervants call him <hi>Maſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly. The word <hi>Maſter,</hi> which is in ſome places rendred <hi>Sir,</hi> is a Title of civil honour, uſed in compellations or ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to others; hereby one man ſhews his civil reſpect and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of ſuch, to whom he ſpeaks: and therefore no man, much leſs a Miniſter, hath any cauſe to renounce that word <hi>Maſter</hi> or <hi>Sir,</hi> which is only civilly tendred unto them from others; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a general command, recorded in the New Teſtament, <hi>To give honor to whom honor is due.</hi> Chriſtianity teaches no man to be uncivil, either by with-holding from others the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 7</note> of honouring them; or by rejecting thoſe civilities of honor, when they are offered: ſeeing all Chriſtians are enjoined in honor <hi>To prefer one another;</hi> and likewiſe there is a ſpecial command, that pious and painfull Miniſters, be counted worthy <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 10. 1 Tim. 5. 7.</note> of double honour: therefore both Miniſters and others may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lawfully (according to this civil ſenſe and uſe of the word) ſuffer themſelves to be courteouſly called <hi>Master</hi> or <hi>Sir.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither doth this appellation thwart Chriſts ſaying, <hi>Be not ye called of men Maſters:</hi> becauſe this Title <hi>Maſter</hi> or <hi>Sir,</hi> in its civil uſe doth not at all import, that they who are ſpoken unto, are thereby called the <hi>Maſters of our faith:</hi> which was the thing forbid unto the Diſciples to be ſo called, becauſe there was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but one ſuch Maſter, even Chriſt himſelf. If the civil calling one <hi>Maſter</hi> or <hi>Sir,</hi> when one is ſpoke unto, had imported that the party who is ſo ſaluted, or ſpoke unto was the Maſter of our faith, then the Apoſtles themſelves would never have ſuffered themſelves to be called <hi>Maſter</hi> or <hi>Sir,</hi> by thoſe who ſpake unto them, without intimating ſome check and controul, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termand, at that time, which we never read of.</p>

                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> chap, 56. and verſe 10, 11, 12. complains of blind, ignorant, dumb, inſufficient, lazy, greedy and drunken watchmen; and ſaith, <hi>They all looked to their own way, every one for his gain from his quarter.</hi> The way which God had appointed for the maintenance of his own watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, was Tithes and offerings: but it ſeems that theſe watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (of whom the Prophet ſpeaks) were uncontent with Gods way: and looked after their own ways of profit, which they had made choiſe of, and found out for themſelves. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one looked for gain from his quarter, expecting in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral abodes, that gain ſhould come in to them, by theſe practiſes for profit, wherein they were exerciſed: even as a man ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his door, expecting ſome welcome gueſt, doth look every way; verily believing that in ſome of the wayes leading to his houſe, he will come: theſe were the men, of whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpake, who looked to their own way, every one for gain from his quarter. But I am not one of them, who did, or who doth thus: I am well content with that maintenance which Gods Word, and the Law of my Nation hath allowed me, according to my ſtation in the Church of Chriſt. I have no felfiſh &amp; by-wayes of gaining and making advantages to my ſelf. God knows that I have hitherto ſought the things of Chriſt, but neither my own advancement nor advantage. If I had applyed my ſelf to worldly gettings, I might have had opportunities enough in theſe ſelf ſeeking times, to have got as good a ſhare therein as ſome others have: but I have uſed none of the ways of worldly getting: The world hath had a ſmall portion of my time, &amp; leſs of my affections: for having devoted my ſelf wholly to fulfill the Miniſtry whereunto Chriſt hath called me, though I have therein gained many diſcouragements from the men of the world, whoſe portion is in this life: yet I have had from Chriſt innumerable Returns of unſpeakable ſpiritual comforts, greatly incouraging me to a perſeverance in his work. I am ſo far from complying with ſuch, who look for their own

Man is uſually ſo ſtraitned in his bowels, that he with much ado is brought to think on pardoning freely his Offenders; but God hath moſt vaſt and large thoughts of pardoning freely and fully ſuch, who having offended him, do repent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto him; exerciſing a new courſe of life, conformable to his own revealed Will in his Word.</p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:119173:22"/>
               <p> Now except thou forſake thine own evil wayes, which are unrighteous, and thy evil thoughts which are ſenſual and earthly, and return to Gods wayes, which are righteous, and to his thoughts which are ſpiritual and heavenly; reſolving to walk according to his Will revealed in his Word: thou will never out of experience, own theſe words in the Prophet, <hi>That Gods thoughts are not as your thoughts, nor your wayes as Gods wayes;</hi> for thy continuance in ſin, will either harden thine heart, to think, that becauſe God doth not preſently puniſh ſin, he is therefore ſuch an one as thy ſelf: or it will indiſpoſe thee to hope for pardon, ſeeing Pardon and Mercy is promiſed only to ſuch, who confeſs and forſake their ſins: or it will provoke God to with hold Mercy; for your iniquities ſeparate between <note place="margin">Pſal. 50. 21 Prov. 28. 13 Iſa. 59. 2.</note> you and your God, and your ſins hides his face from you that he will not hear.</p>
               <p>Would thou experimentally own theſe words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 8. Would thou find Gods thoughts of Mercy towards thee, and his acts of pardoning thee, to be beyond all that thou can imagine, and think of? Oh then forſake all thy ſinfull wayes, and courſes whatſoever; and do not reſolve to rob God; do not continue in deſpiſing the publick preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Word, in the congregation of his people: and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all thy ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <q>ART not thou one of them, that bears Rule by thy means, which the Lord ſent <hi>Jeremy</hi> to cry againſt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. which was an horrible filthy thing committed in the Land, and the people loved to have it ſo, for which God would viſit them? I in holding up ſuch, do I obey the Prophets voice, or am one of the fooliſh people, that hath eyes, and ſee not, and hath ears, and hear not, without the fear of God, holding up ſuch as bear Rule by their means? Did they not look upon <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> as one being deceived; and was not he caſt into priſon and Dungeon? Did not the Prieſts and the Princes ſay, <hi>He was worthy of death.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I perceive that thy miſ-underſtanding the words of the Prophet, hath cauſed thee to ſtumble into very groſs appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, which one conſiderately reading this thy Propoſal, may eaſily diſcern to be couched therein. Thy expreſſions ſeems to hold out theſe things,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Maintenance, called (ſometimes in our Engliſh, though not in other languages) <hi>Means,</hi> which the Prieſts in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiahs</hi> time had, was diſallowed by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. That the Prieſts in that Prophets time did rule by their means, or by that maintenance which they had.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That that was the horrible thing, which <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaith, was committed in the land, that the Prieſts bare rule by their Maintenance or Means; and that they were ſup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>orted in their Rule, by the Maintenance or Means which they had from the people.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the people loved ſo to maintain their Prieſts, they loved to have it ſo, and therefore God would viſit them for it; And,</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:119173:23"/> 5. That if thou, or any other, ſhall pay unto me, or any other ſetled Miniſter any thing, from whence means that is (according to thy apprehenſion) Maintenance ſhould ariſe to us: then ye ſhould be holders of us up, in bearing Rule by Means: and be diſobeyers of the Prophets voyce, and be one of the fooliſh people (of whom the Prophet ſpeaks) who had eyes and ſee not, and are without the fear of God.</p>
               <p>To help to rectifie thy Miſ-underſtanding things: I will,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Prove that the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> did not at all diſallow of that Maintenance or Means, which the Prieſts of the Lord had in his dayes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I will evidence that the true Rule, which the Prieſts in <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miahs</hi> time had, was eſtabliſhed upon Divine Authority, and did not ariſe unto them from that Means or Maintenance which they had.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I will tell thee plainly, from the words of the Prophet, what that horrible filthy thing was, which the Prophet ſaith was committed in the Land, whereby it willl appear: that neither the Prieſts bearing Rule, nor their having Maintenance or Means: nor yet the peoples paying unto them their due Maintenance or Means, was that horrible filthy thing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I will declare, for what the Lord (in that Chapter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged) doth threaten to viſit the people; and that it was not for their paying unto their Prieſts their due Maintenance or Means.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I will after all this punctually anſwer to thy Demands, which concerns my ſelf, and which concerns thy ſelf, and which concerns the Prophet: and ſo a full Anſwer will be rendred to thy fourth Propoſal.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There are four conſiderations which clearly manifeſt that the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> did not diſallow of that Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or Means which the Prieſts of the Lord had in his time: they are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He taxeth the Prieſts for many of their ſins; for their Ignorance, for their profaneneſs, and that in the houſe of God; for their unfaithfulneſs in executing their Office: for <note place="margin">Ier. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 8. Ier. 23. 11. Ier. 6. 13, 14.</note> their oppoſing the true, and countenancing the falſe Prophets; and yet he doth not in any of his Chapters reprove them, or any of them, for their receiving from people Tithes and Offerings, which was a Maintenance appointed by God, for
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119173:23"/> the livelihood of his Prieſts: and therefore the Maintenance of the Prieſts in the time of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was not a thing diſallowed by him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> promiſes from the Lord, <hi>That if</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 17. 24. 25. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>the Kings of Judah, and all Judah, and the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, will but hallow the Sabbath, to do no work therein, that Kings and Princes ſitting on the Throne of</hi> David, <hi>and that</hi> Judah, <hi>and the City</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>ſhall be establiſhed to remain:</hi> and that from places and Cities adjoyning round about, people ſhould bring Offerings and Sacrifices, and meat Offerings, and Incenſe, and Sacrifices of praiſe unto the houſe of the Lord. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet mentions Offerings and Sacrifice, from whence no ſmall part of the Prieſts Maintenance aroſe: He promiſes theſe, which plainly intimates, that he did not diſallow of the Maintenance of the Prieſts and Levites in his time.</p>
               <p n="3">3. After <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Temple was deſtroyed, where Sacrifices uſed to be offered: Fourſcore men with Offerings <note place="margin">Ier. 41. 5, 6, 7.</note> and Incenſe in their hand, to bring them to the houſe of the Lord, came to <hi>Mizpah,</hi> and were ſlain by <hi>Iſhmael</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, who relates the Hiſtory, doth not any wayes reprove, or blame that Act of theirs, in bringing Offerings and Incenſe, from whence the Prieſts had ſome ſhare and portion for their Maintenance: which Act had it been unlawfull, the Prophet would not have let the mention thereof paſs, without ſome cenſure: but ſeeing the Prophet did not cenſure it, it is plain, that he did not diſallow of the Maintenance of the Prieſts, of the Lord in his time.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Prophet relates the affluence of bleſſings, which ſhall be to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at their return to God in the full Converſion of their Nation: and he doth particularly intimate that a large and liberal proviſion ſhall be made for the Prieſts (who are a principal part of the State) wherewith they and theirs ſhall be in a very plentifull manner maintained: <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>ſatiate the ſoul of the Prieſts with fatneſs, as he</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 31. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>promiſes alſo to ſtore the people with abundance of all good things And my people</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>ſhall be ſatisfied with goodneſs.</hi> The more Gods bleſſings abound to his people, among whom his Prieſts miniſter and teach; his Prieſts do fare the better, by reaſon that Tithes and Offerings then come unto them in <note place="margin">2 Chron. 31. 5.</note> greater abundance, as they did to them in the dayes of <hi>Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:119173:24"/> wherein God greatly bleſſed him, and the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom under him.</p>
               <p>Methinks it is very clear from theſe paſſages in the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> that he did not diſallow of the maintenance or Means which the Prieſts of the Lord had in his time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I affirm: That the true Rule which the Prieſts had in <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> time, was preſcribed to them by Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. This is very clear; becauſe the order of Rule was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved among them in that time, which God himſelf had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed: namely, that the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> ſhould attend on the holy ſervice, and on teaching the Judgements and Statutes of God. This order God ordained, that their ſhould be an high Prieſt, who was to command all the reſt: and that there ſhould <note place="margin">Deut. 33. 10.</note> likewiſe be a chief Prieſt, who are called the Rulers of the Sanctuary, and Governors of the houſe of God: that is, of <note place="margin">1 Chro. 14 5.</note> things pertaining to the ſervice of God in his houſe. They ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed their brethren the Prieſts and Levites to their ſervice, and directed them in their courſes: beſides their was ordinary Prieſts and Levites to ſerve in meaner ſervices, and to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Prieſts in Rule and Governing. This order of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and governing among the Prieſts, ſetled by God, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue throughout ſeveral generations of the <hi>Jewiſh Nation,</hi> and remained unaltered, though the Prieſts had contracted much corruption in the time of <hi>Jeremiah.</hi> He prophecied in the dayes of <hi>Joſiah</hi> and of <hi>Jehoiakin,</hi> and of <hi>Zedekiah:</hi> in which time <hi>Hilkiah</hi> was high Prieſt; and ſo was <hi>Azariah,</hi> and ſo was <hi>Seraiah,</hi> who was put to death by the King of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> at <hi>Riblah,</hi> This Prophet alſo makes mention of <hi>Paſhur</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 52. 24, 27. Ier. 1. 20. Ier. 33. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 26, 21, 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> the ſon of <hi>Immer</hi> the Prieſt, who was a chief Governour in the houſe of the Lord: and of <hi>Maaſeiah,</hi> and other ordinary Prieſts. And tells us from God, that al time ſhould come, wherein God would multiply the <hi>Levites</hi> that miniſter to him.</p>
               <p>This was that true rule obſerved among the Prieſts in the time of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> which was eſtabliſhed by divine Authority, and was not (as thou and others ſuppoſe) obtained by their maintenance or means.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Touching that horrible filthy thing, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith was committed in the Land; The Prophets words <note place="margin">Ier. 5. 31.</note> are very plain,</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:119173:24"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A powerfull and horrible thing is committed in the Land: the Prophets prophecy falſly, and the Priests bear rule by their means, and my people love to have it ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That wonderfull horrible thing was the conſpiracy or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Prophets, Prieſts and people in evil: and thus it was, the Prophets prophecied lyes: the Prieſts upheld them in their lyes, and the people did wondrous well like of ſuch lies: ſo it is expreſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Prophets prophecied falſly. Some of them prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied <note place="margin">Ier. 2. 8.</note> by <hi>Baal;</hi> they were Idolaters: and they taught people to worſhip the Idol <hi>Baal:</hi> they taught a lye, to worſhip an Idol for the true God: and though ſome others of them profeſſed the worſhip of <hi>Jehovah</hi> the true God, yet they uttered lyes in his name; promiſing to the deſpiſers of the Lord, and to wicked <note place="margin">Ier. 23. 16, 17. Ier, 8. 11.</note> Livers, peace and ſafety, and ſo they hardened people in their wickedneſs. The ſinne of the Prophets was, they prophecied falſly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Priests,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jeremiah, bear rule by their Means,</hi> ſo the words are rendred in our Engliſh Bibles; whereas in the original language, in which the Prophecy of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was writ, the words are, <hi>the Prieſts take upon, or by the hand of them.</hi> The ſin of theſe Prieſts then was this;</p>
               <p n="1">1. They ruled upon, or over the hand of them; that is, they took on them, to protect theſe falſe Prophets in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull deeds: when (according to the Law) they ſhould have been put to death, for ſpeaking falſhood, to thruſt people out of the way, which the Lord their God commanded them to walk in: and the Lord threatens that theſe falſe Prophets ſhall be conſumed; becauſe they prophecied lyes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They ruled, or took by the hand of them; that is, they by the help or inſtigation of theſe falſe Prophets, whom they countenanced, and with whom they had combined, took a tyrannical courſe, to ſuppreſs the true Prophets of the Lord. An <note place="margin">Deut, 13. 5. Ier. 14. 14. 15.</note> inſtance whereof is in the 26. Chapter; where the Prieſts as principal Actors, with the falſe Prophets their ſeconds, did ſpeak to the Princes, and people, that <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was worthy to die, becauſe he had prophecied againſt the City. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the Prieſts by the hand or help of the falſe Prophets, (flatteringly magnifying them, and their rule, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the corruptions therein reproved by the true Prophets)
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119173:25"/> contained to rule the people, without amending in themſelves what was amiſs: and they boldly confirmed the plauſible lyes of the falſe Prophets, by teaching alſo the people the ſame falſhoods, and not to believe the true Prophets, who had threatned, that eminent dangers ſhould befall them for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in their ſins: and therefore this Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains that from the <hi>Prophet unto the Prieſt every one dealeth falſly. and that they healed the hurt of the people ſteightly.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 6. 14,</note> Falſhood in teaching began by theſe falſe Prophets, and was continued by the Prieſts: <hi>For from the Prophets of Jeruſalem is profaneneſs gone forth into all the Land:</hi> they handed firſt their lying Prophecies, which wrought profaneneſs: and <note place="margin">Ier. 23 24.</note> the Prieſts took at, or by their hands theſe lyes, and in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing handed them over to the people, who imbraced and hugged them from them both. The ſin of the Prieſts then in brief was, their protecting the falſe Prophets, and combining with them to deſtroy the true Prophets, and to delude the people by lyes and falſhoods.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is ſaid that the people love to have it ſo. The ſin of the people was their deſpiſing the holy Counſel, and divine Alarms to Repentance, which was given unto them by the holy Prophets of God: they counted their words as wind, vain, <note place="margin">Ier. 5. 13.</note> and of none effect: and they loved the flatteries of the falſe Prophets, and loved to have them and their Prieſts, to ſooth them in their ſins, by telling them falſhoods pleaſing and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their liking, and eſpecially this, <hi>That evil ſhall not come unto them.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 5. 12.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thou may now underſtand, that that horrible filthy thing which the Prophet ſaith was committed in the Land, was not the Prieſts bearing true rule; nor their having maintenance or Means: nor the peoples paying unto them their due mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or Means: for in no one place in his Prophecy, the Prophet mentions theſe in a condemnatory way: But it was the Prophets, Prieſts, and peoples agreeing in evil. The Prophets prophecying lyes: and the Prieſts upholding them in their Lyes, and ſeeking the deſtruction of the true Prophets, who gain-ſaid their Lyes, and cloſing with theſe falſe ones inventing lyes to the people: and the people being well pleaſed with their Lyes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Conſider for what the Lord doth threaten to viſit
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119173:25"/> this people he ſaith twice in one Chapter, <hi>Shall I not viſit</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 5. 9, 29</note> 
                  <hi>for theſe things, ſaith the Lord, and ſhall not my ſoul be aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on ſuch a Nation as this is?</hi> and we are plainly told in the ſame Chapter for what ſinnes the Lord would do ſo. Namely,</p>
               <p n="1">1. For their deficiency toward judgement, in not executing it, and towards truth, in not ſeeking it, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For their hypocriſie under a pretence of piety committing perjury, <hi>ver.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For their obſtinacy, and not amending under their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and corrections, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For their Apoſtaſie, Idolatry, and impudent common Adulteries, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. for theſe God threatens to viſit them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For the infidelity in not believing Gods threatnings.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For their ſecurity though threatned.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For their ſlighting the true Prophets, who had threatned them, to be deſtroyed, by a Nation, mighty and ancient, whoſe language was unknown to them, and not underſtood by them, <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 14, 15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For their revolting and rebellious heart, in forſaking the true God, and ſerving ſtrange gods.</p>
               <p n="9">9. For their fooliſhneſſe in not conſidering either Gods greatneſſe, his mighty power, manifeſt in the world: nor yet his ſpecial goodneſs, manifeſt towards themſelves, to be hereby moved, to fear him, <hi>verſe</hi> 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.</p>
               <p n="10">10. For their crafty circumventing others, unlawfully getting their ſtates from them. And,</p>
               <p n="11">11. For their not judging aright in matters of judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: the Lord ſaith, ſhall I not viſit for theſe things, and ſhall not my ſoul be avenged on ſuch a Nation as this, <hi>verſe</hi> 26, 27, 28, 29.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the ſins recorded, for which God doth threaten to viſit that people: but paying unto Prieſts their due mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or means was no ſin: for what God hath commanded to be done, and had not repealed, it was a Duty, and the not doing it; or the not paying maintenance to the Prieſts, had been a ſinne: ſo alſo the lawful rule of the Prieſts was no ſin, becauſe it was appointed, and not reverſed in <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> time: I ſay, as theſe was no ſin, ſo the Prophet could not, and doth not threaten
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119173:26"/> either the Prieſts, for receiving due maintenance from the people, or the people, for paying it unto them: neither doth he, nor could he threaten the Prieſts, for exerciſing that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly government, which by appointment was charged their Tribe to obſerve.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, I now come to anſwer thy demand concerning my ſelf, and concerning thy ſelf, and concerning the Prophet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Touching my ſelf thou doſt ask.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Art not thou one of them that beare rule by meanes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If by the word meanes in this thy demand, thou underſtands that maintenance or portion of temporal live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, which God and the Laws of my Nation allots me: then I muſt tell thee, that as there is no man on earth, neither worldly, nor Church-rulers, nor any other of any other ſort of men, who can ſubſiſt in it, altogether without any tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral maintenance or meanes: (as thou calls it) for ſubſtract from any, food and man raiment, and other neceſſaries befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to have, for the diſcharge of his calling in which God hath placed him, And he will ſoon be diſenabled from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming both the acts of it, and from continuing among men in acting as a man: ſo I acknowledge, that while I tread upon the earth, I am and muſt be in the condition of all mortals, juſt as the Prophets were of old, ſubject to like paſſions as <note place="margin">Iam. 5. 17.</note> other men. I am not exempt from that ordinary ſtate, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and way of temporal living in the world, to which God hath ſubjected all men. All men are Gods beggars, a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of indigent creatures, depending on him daily and hourly, both for the having, and for the continuing unto them, that temporal livelihood, which he thinks fit to diſtribute to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſeveral man in his ſtation; and therefore though I and other Miniſters ſhall ſtand in need of all temporal things, which are neceſſary, for our temporary ſubſiſtence, as we are men, and for the performance of our calling, as we are Miniſters ruling in the Church of Chriſt: yet neither thou, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, can juſtly blame us more then your ſelves or other other men, for having maintenance or meanes in our temporal
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119173:26"/> condition. And it is a very falſe conceit that we rule in the Church, by maintenance or meanes, becauſe we cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out maintenance or meanes live in the world: For as a King rules in a Common-wealth, not by the revenues, mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <note place="margin">Eccl. 5. 9.</note> or means, which he receives from his Subjects. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſaith a King hath maintenance from the field, as well as other men: the profit of the earth is for all, the King himſelf is ſerved by the field: but a King rules by the Authority, wherewith he is inveſted from God, and by the Laws of the Nation over whom he rules: So likewiſe Miniſters rule in the Church of Chriſt, not by that temporal means or mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which God, and the Laws of the Nation hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to receive: but by that Authority, which they have received from the Lord to rule, and by thoſe Laws, which Chriſt hath preſcribed unto them in his holy Word, to rule people by.</p>
               <p>I anſwer then plainly to thy demand. I am not one of them, that bear rule by any temporal maintenance or meanes, though while I continue in the world, diſcharging duties, required of me as I am a man, and as I am a Miniſter of Chriſt, I ſhall need outward means or mainteance, as well as all other men ſhall have need of the like, while they live, and are to do duties as men, and as they are men in ſuch callings, wherein it pleaſeth God to imploy them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I anſwer. If by the word means, thou underſtand by this thy demand the very ſame thing, which the Lord ſent <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to cry againſt: then I directly anſwer: I am not one of them, that bears rule by the hand, help, or meanes of any falſe Teacher, which are in theſe our dayes. I neither do nor can (as the Prieſts againſt whom <hi>Jeremy</hi> cried did and could) protect any of them in their falſhoods. I never was magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by any ſuch, as the Prieſts were, of whom <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpeaks in his fifth Chapter.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Jeremiah</hi> was a true Prophet of the Lord, and he oft denounced judgements againſt the whole Land, againſt <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and againſt the Temple therein: but the falſe prophets to pleaſe the people, prophecied otherwayes, and the people believed rather the lies, uttered by the falſe, then the truths which were ſpoke by the true Prophets; being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Ier. 5. 12.</note> confident that evil ſhould not come upon them; and they finding that judgements threatned by <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was not ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily executed, did continually mock him: <hi>The Word of the Lord</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>was a reproach unto me, and a deriſion,</hi> dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <note place="margin">Jer. 20. 8.</note> Thus the true Prophet was accounted as one who was deceived.</p>
               <p>Moreover <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was falſely accuſed, for intending to fall <note place="margin">Jer. 37. 13, 14, 15.</note> to the <hi>Caldeans:</hi> and the Princes believing the accuſation did caſt him into priſon.</p>
               <p>And upon the Princes petitioning againſt him, that he <note place="margin">Ier. 38. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> weakned the hands of the men of War, and the hands of the people, and ſought not the welfare of the people, but their hurt; he was let down into a dungeon, wherein he did ſink in the mire.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we alſo read that the Prieſts, and the Prophets, and all <note place="margin">Ier. 26. 7, 8 9, 10, 11.</note> the People having heard his threatning Sermon, that God would make the Temple like <hi>Shiloh,</hi> and the City a curſe to all the Nations of the Earth, they took him, and ſaid, he ſhould die, and the Prieſts and Prophets ſpake to the Princes, and to all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſaying, <hi>this man is worthy to die, for he hath prophecyed againſt this City.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By what is related, thy three demands, which concerne the Prophet are eaſily anſwered: namely, the people did look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> as on one being deceived: he was caſt into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and a Dungeon: And the Prieſts and falſe prophets ſaid, he was worthy of death: and the Princes petitioned that he ſhould be put to death.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Micah, Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Ver.</hi> 11. condemnes ſuch Prophets who divined for money, and ſuch Prieſts who taught for hire: we have out of holy Scripture this account of them, what they were. <hi>Micah</hi> ſaith that theſe prophets <note place="margin">Mich. 3. 5.</note> were ſuch, who made the people to erre; who did bite with their teeth, who cried peace: who prepared war againſt them, who did not put into their mouth. The meaning is: they taught errours; they did teare the true Prophets with their teeth, in their railing evil language, uttered through the teeth: they flattered and ſoothed people in their ſins, promiſing them peace: they ſought to trouble them who did not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and feaſt them, and did not comply with them in what they ſaid, and applaud their ſayings. Theſe were the men, who in <hi>Micahs</hi> dayes prophecied for money: they would
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119173:29"/> in their prophecyings forbear to ſpeak any penitential word, <note place="margin">Mich. 2. 6.</note> which humbles and ſhames ſinners: and they would for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſpeak preſumptuous, or licentious words, to encourage <note place="margin">Mic. 2. 11.</note> people in ſinne, and particularly in their drunkenneſſe or exceſſe, and it is certaine that the Prieſts who taught for hire, were only unfaithful and corrupt Prieſts, who being uncontent with their portion of Glebes, Tithes and Offerings, which God had appointed, ſhould be aſſigned unto them, they would alſo be hired, to ſpeak what pleaſed the people, and juſtified them in their ſins: making them believe, that Gods Word did as well approve of the profane, and uncleane, as it did of the holy <note place="margin">Eze. 22. 26</note> and clean, not ſhewing the difference of them.</p>
               <p>To thy queſtion then: <q>Art not thou one of them, who divines for money, and teacheth for hire.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, I am not any ſuch man who doth ſo: thy ſuppoſal that I and other faithful Miniſters have done ſo, is moſt unjuſt: for we make not our people to erre, as did the falſe prophets of whom <hi>Micah</hi> ſpeaks, by teaching them lies and falſehoods; we do not raile upon, and ſpeak all manner of evil of the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, as the falſe prophets did of the true Prophets of the Lord, tearing them with their teeth, and ſmiting them with their tongue. We do not flatter and ſooth people in their ſins, as did theſe falſe prophets: we do not (as theſe falſe prophets did) ſeek to vex thoſe, who do not afford us entertainment, and embracement. We do not forbear (when a juſt oceaſion is offered) to rebuke our people ſharply, and to make them aſhamed of ſinne. We do not ſpeak licentious, or preſumptuous words, to encourage people in their ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as did the falſe prophets: we do not countenance any falſe teachers, nor yet for baſe gaine (as did the unfaithful corrupt Prieſts) ſeek in our teachings to pleaſe, and juſtifie peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their ſinful courſes: For we ſpeak not to pleaſe men, but God, who trieth our hearts: we dare do nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth. God hath appointed us his ſervants <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2. 4</note> in office, to preſerve holy knowledge, and to diſpenſe it to his people. We are no hirelings of any mortal creature: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will we be hired for any worldly conſiderations, either to betray, or to belie Gods truth: though oppoſitions and hatred
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:119173:29"/> from worldlings proves to be our portion, for our preaching for Chriſts ſake the truths of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And be it known unto thee, and to all the world: that though I, and other faithful Miniſters of the Goſpel, have from God, and the Laws of the Nation tythes allowed unto us, from whence money ariſes for ſupply of our temporal needs; yet tythes and money ariſing thence, is not the ſcope, and end of our teaching. We are thankful unto Chriſt for providing for us in this manner: whereby we are freed from many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions in his ſervice, and from avocations from it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with other Miniſters (as they complain) are cloyed, who muſt ride far and wait long upon Treaſurers, and other men for their Salary. We preach not for tythes, and money accruing to us thence, but out of love to Chriſt Jeſus our Maſter, and out of conſcience to diſcharge faithfully our calling and duty, and out of compaſſion to our people to ſave them from death, to gaine them to Chriſt, and to turn them from the power of Satan unto God. For this it is we labour and preach, ſpending our ſelves, and being ſpent in ſtudy and preaching, not ſeeking theirs, but them: <hi>Neither count we our life dear unto us, ſo we may finiſh our courſe with joy, and the Miniſtry, which we have received of the Lord, to testifie to our people the Grace of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We well know; that if we would make money our end, and aime in this world; there are other courſes advantagious and enough contentive, to be took, forgetting that: and not this courſe of conſuming our ſelves from morning to night, and many times in the night, in ſtudy, in tiring our ſpirits, in mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of our ſoules in ſecret, for the obſtinacy, of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly, unteachable, ungodly and unconſcionable ſinners, who care not how uncivilly, unjuſtly, and fraudulently they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from Chriſt our Maſter, their duties, and from us, his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, their dues and rights; briefly we preach not for money, but for the good of our people, that they may be ſtamped with Gods image in Chriſt, and may not prove reprobate ſilver, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected of God. We do not preach for hire (though God giveth it unto us) but to bring people to <hi>partake of the inheritance of the Saints in light, with God, and with Chriſt, for ever and ever.</hi>

Perhaps thou calls my preaching againſt them a preparing warre againſt thee: but I conteſt not againſt thy perſon, but againſt thy corruption; I muſt lift up my voice like a Trumpet, to ſhew my people their tranſgreſſion and their ſins: and I will not be bribed by any either to hold my peace, and be ſilent: or to ſpeak unto you peace, thereby to encourage you, in any of thoſe abominations, which you reſolve to follow.</p>

That there is a company of falſe prophets, Enthuſiaſts, ſelf-making teachers in theſe our dayes: they pretend they have new lights, the only revelations of God: and therefore that they are ſent from him, to teach the people: but they make them to erre: and they do raile on, and revile the Preachers of the Goſpel: they cry peace and applauſe to all their followers: though they know that many of them ſpeak evil of Dignities, and diſorderly leave their callings, and run about in Countreys; theſe falſe teachers alſo diſdaine, and deſtroy, and damne all thoſe people, who (as they think) are not for them and their wayes. And in their ſpeakings (as I have it told credibly from

Such teaching doth wonderfully pleaſe men carnally and worldly-minded; and ſo greedy are ſuch teachers to drain to themſelves maintenance, that ſome of them by ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king together ſummes of money from the benevolences of their followers, have been ſuddenly enriched: and after a ſhort while of continuing in this their courſe, have become purchaſers of ſomething conſiderable. Theſe falſe teachers looking after their unlawful and ſordid gaine, and getting, do very ſuitably reſemble the falſe prophets, who did divine for money, of whom <hi>Micah</hi> complained.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p>Firſt know, that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in the 34. chapter quoted by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighers againſt the evil Shepherds of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Theſe ſhepherds were their wicked Princes, and their wicked civil Governours, and their wicked Prieſts, their Church-rulers.

               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:119173:33"/>
               <p> Their regarding themſelves is in this wiſe expreſſed by the Prophet: <hi>Ye eate the fat, and ye cloath you with the wool.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe words <hi>(ye eat the fat)</hi> the Prophet ſhews that wicked Prieſts, called ſhepherds, ſinned in feeding themſelves with that delicate, excellent, and choiſe food, the fat, which God had forbid them to eat: for God had made it a perpetual Statute in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for all their Generations throughout all their <note place="margin">Lev. 3. 17.</note> habitations, that no <hi>Iſraelite</hi> ſhould eat the fat: and that whoſoever did eat it, he ſhould be cut off from the People. <note place="margin">Lev. 7. 23, 25</note> Theſe wicked men would for the ſatisfying of their own bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies diſobey Gods command; and by that act manifeſted, that they made their bellies their god; and this ſinne was the more heinous in theſe wicked Prieſts, becauſe they had a ſpecial <note place="margin">Lev. 3. 14, 15, 16.</note> charge to burn the fat: but being uncontent with that porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſhoulder and breaſt, and other things of offerings, which was allowed unto them from God, and being addicted to fair finely, and to ſatisfie their liquoriſh taſte, they (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law of God) would have the fat to eat, which was as unlawful for them, as for any other <hi>Iſraelite.</hi> It <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 13, 14.</note> ſeemes they would herein imitate, <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas,</hi> the wicked ſons of <hi>Eli,</hi> who would not burn the fat, but would have it with fleſh to roſt, and by violence took it: they are blamed for eating fat contrary to the Law, and it was a robbery from the holy offerings, made by them which they ought not to have done.</p>
               <p>Again, in theſe words <hi>(ye cloath you with the wool)</hi> or ye put on your ſelves with wool, but feed not the flock: The Prophet blames them for regarding their cloaths more then their calling: for minding the arraying themſelves with wooll, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then their diſcharging their duty to the flock, or their ſervice in the manner which they ought: for it was the duty of the <note place="margin">Lev. 6. 4, 23, 32. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Their not regarding the the feeding of the flock, is expreſſed by the Prophet, who plainly ſets down their demeanour both towards the ſound, and toward the diſtempered part of the flock.</p>
               <p>Their behaviour towards the ſound part of the flock is thus related: ye kill them that are fed.</p>

               <p>Others underſtand by them who were fed, ſuch of the flock, who had been formerly well taught by the holy Prieſts, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Levites, and good Prophets, and had thickned or thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven well by their Doctrine in the knowledge and underſtanding of Gods Law. Theſe were killed by theſe wicked ſhepherds, (who had no natural care of the good of the flock) partly by their ſtarving them, in not affording them viſion, to keep <note place="margin">Pro. 29. 18</note> them from periſhing: and partly by poyſoning them with errours, and lying falſhoods which they frequently taught in thoſe days, in <hi>perverting the Word of the living God, and violating</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now whether it be underſtood, that theſe wicked ſhepherds had an hand, in actual diſpatching the well-fed of the flock, from their temporal lives and livelihoods: or that they only ſlew them in their ſpirituals, by depriving their ſoules of its neceſſaries, and by poyſoning them, with corrupt abominations; it is plain, that their demeanour was very wicked towards thoſe of the flock, who were ſound.</p>
               <p>Their carriage towards thoſe of the flock, which was diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, is related to be evil enough in general to them all, &amp; very evil in many particulars to ſome of them; for thus the Prophet writes. <hi>The diſeaſed have ye not ſtrengthned, neither have ye</hi>

                  <hi>healed that which was ſick: neither have ye bound up that which was broken: neither have ye brought againe that which was driven away: neither have ye ſought that which was lost: but with force, and with cruelty have ye ruled them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe words the Prophet indites theſe wicked ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, for not exerciſing thoſe acts of their calling, which the diſtreſſe of their flock called on them to performe; as namely.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly, I am to anſwer thy demands, which concerns my ſelfe; thus thou writes.</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>Art not thou one of them that ſeeks for the fleece: and hath made a prey upon the people in this cloudy and dark day, and with force and cruelty ruled over them?</q>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The wicked ſhepherds or Prieſts (of whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks) being uncontent with the tenths and offerings allowed to them, did ſeek to have alſo a ſhare in thoſe fleeces, and other goods of the people, which was the ninth part, which God ordained that the people ſhould poſſeſſe. And theſe Prieſts would by violence and tyrannical cruelty (as hath been ſhewed) wreſt from the people, what was undue unto the Prieſt. I am neither one of thoſe, nor yet like any of theſe, who ſeeks to have from people, either fleeces, or any other goods which is not due to me; but truly I am like one of thoſe holy Levites, and religious Prieſts (in thoſe times) who did onely ſeek and look after their dues of tithe fleeces, and other tythes, from thoſe who were to pay it unto them; and as it was in them no ſin to do ſo, no more is it in me or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other faithful Miniſter a ſinne, to demand, and ſeek after, and receive that which is our due (as tithes are) God and the Laws of our Nation, having allotted them unto us. There is neither illegality, nor any iniquity in that act, for which we can be juſtly taxed: though both injuſtice and iniquity was in the wicked Prieſts in taking and wreſting from people unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully that which was the peoples, and was no wayes due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Prieſts.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>Art not thou one of them that hath made a prey upon the people in this cloudy and dark day?</q>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer. I have not made any kinde of prey upon any one of the people, either in the cloudy and dark day of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions late Civil Warre and calamity: or yet in any other day whatſoever.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:119173:36"/>
               <p> There is a twofold kinde of prey, which men make upon one another. 1. All the ſpoile, which (in a time of peace, when <note place="margin">Iſa. 10. 1, 2</note> there is no warre) is got by unjuſt acts, and unlawful arts, is <note place="margin">Eze. 38. 12 13</note> called a prey. 2. All ſpoile took in war by enemies, or from enemies is alſo called a prey.</p>
               <p>The people (of whom the Prophet in the 34. of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaks, that they were made a prey) were both wayes preyed upon in the dark and cloudy day of the Nations calamity and captivity. In all the former part of that day (which began at the firſt declination of the State, and ended with their captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) the people of the Land endured great and unjuſt taxations, oppreſſions, perſecutions and ſpoilings, from their Princes and other Rulers, from their wicked Prieſts and falſe prophets. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiakim</hi> taxed the Land, and exacted ſilver and gold of every <note place="margin">2 King. 23. 35. Ier. 26. 20 Eze. 22. 27 Ezek. 45. 8 9</note> one of the people of the Land, according to the taxation: and he ſlew <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rijah</hi> the Prophet. The Princes alſo in that time was exceeding covetous, ſhedding blood to get gaine: they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and exacted on people, ſpoiling them; yea and the wicked Prieſts and prophets were alſo covetous, to have from people deceitfully and cruelly, what did not legally belong unto them: from the leaſt to the greateſt of them, every one was <note place="margin">Ier. 6. 13.</note> given to covetouſneſs: and from the Prophet to the Prieſt, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one dealt falſely; thus that people was made a prey upon before their captivity.</p>
               <p>In the latter part of that cloudy and dark day of ſufferings, which was at their captivity: theſe people were then made a prey by Heathens; both by thoſe who led them captives, the <hi>Chaldeans;</hi> and alſo by the neighbouring Heathens, who help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on that captivity, as be the <hi>Edomites,</hi> who laid hands on <note place="margin">Obadiah 13. 14.</note> their ſubſtance, and did cut off thoſe who did eſcape: yea, they were then made deſolate, and were ſwallowed up on every ſide, becoming a prey, and deriſion to the reſidue of the Heathen that were round about.</p>
               <p>In this manner, and no otherwiſe (that I read of) did theſe peoples own Princes, Prieſts and falſe prophets, and their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies make a prey upon them, in the day of their ſufferings and utter ſuppreſſing.</p>
               <p>To thy demand I truly ſay: I have not to my knowledge, by any unjuſt act, or unlawful arts, in the times of peace, got any thing from any of the people, which was juſtly theirs: neither
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:119173:37"/> have I in the times of the late wars took from any by violence, or force, or any other unlawful courſe, any thing, which was juſtly theirs to poſſeſſe: and therefore I am not one of thoſe, nor like one of thoſe, of whom the Prophet ſpake, who made a prey upon the people in the cloudy and dark day of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, troubles and tribulations. I have been in all theſe times, and am ſtill content with the tithes, which by Gods and mans Law are due unto me; knowing full well, that the taking of theſe of the people, is an act juſt and righteous in the ſight both of God and man: knowing alſo that an underſtanding and juſt man cannot account, that a Miniſters taking the tithes, which are his dues from the people, is a making a prey upon the people: unleſſe he conceives alſo, that the asking and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving by any one of the people, their rents, and of their due debts, from any of their debtors, is a making a prey upon their debtors in this dark and cloudy day: but ſure they are under a judgement of great darkneſſe and cloudineſſe, who judge thus either of the Miniſters, or of the peoples receiving of their dues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3. <hi>To that other part of thy Demand, which is,</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Art not thou one of them that hath with force and cruelty ruled over them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer. I have not uſed either force, or cruelty towards any of my people. This is my rejoycing, even the teſtimony of my conſcience, that I (as became a Miniſter of God) have ſhewed gentleneſſe towards all men, and have been patient, and in meekneſſe have inſtructed them that oppoſe themſelves, if God peradventure would give them repentance to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the truth. I have not uſed among them <note place="margin">Zac. 11. 15</note> the inſtruments of a fooliſh wicked ſhepherd, as did the wicked ſhepherds of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> namely, the ſheeres of violence to take from them what is their right, and the knife of cruelty to butcher their perſons, and deſtroy their lives: but I have uſed only the inſtruments of a good ſhepherd: namely, the ſpirit of love, and of meekneſſe, to perſwade them to do that which is right according to Gods, and mans Law, agreeing with Gods, which is their duty, and the rod of a righteous Law, to drive
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:119173:37"/> ſuch into the paths of righteouſneſſe, who have ſtraied from rightful into wrong doing, and will be no other wayes redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, to do that which is right, which is their duty. The Law which I have been ſometime conſtrained from ſome, to make uſe of, for the recovering of my dues, as alſo all other men may lawfully uſe the ſame courſe, in appealing to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and the Laws of the Land, when other courſes cannot prevaile to obtaine what belongs unto them from men reſolved to wrong them: I ſay this Law is clamoured againſt by ſuch men who do wrong, and deſire to do wrong to others, as if it were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but force and cruelty. Theſe exorbitant and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient men ſpeak evil of the things which they do not, or are not willing to underſtand: for the juſt Laws of a Nation, are Proprietaries Sanctuary, the reliever of the oppreſſed, and the appointer of due ſufferings to thoſe that do evil, and wrong their brethren. <hi>The Law</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is good, if it be uſed lawfully, knowing that the Law is made for the lawleſſe,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 8 9.</note> 
                  <hi>and diſobedient:</hi> namely for ſuch people who are licentiouſly and rebelliouſly diſpoſed; the Law is to bring ſuch to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and to practiſe their duty, who without its determinations will not out of a willing minde, apply themſelves to that which is right and juſt. Briefly, I have not at all uſed either force or cruelty towards any of my people: but I have applyed my ſelf to do that which is juſt and righteous, fit for me to do, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law or Word of God, as I am a Miniſter of the Church: and according to the Laws of my Nation, as I am a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Common-wealth.</p>

They whom the Apoſtle ſpake of, cauſed offences; namely, both to the right believers, who were juſtly offended by theſe mens fomenting of diviſions and ſeparations: and alſo unto profeſſional believers: whoſe bitter cenſurings, judgings and deſpiſings of one another (whereby the weak and ſtrong in

               <p n="3">3. They of whom the Apoſtle ſpake, did pretend that they did ſerve the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, hoping thereby to gain cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the people, and ſo the more unſuſpectedly to work on them, to divide from one another in their affections, and Congregations; but the Apoſtle ſaith, that thoſe men ſerved not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: and he fervently prayed for the peoples exemption from ſuch a dividing deluſion, ſaying, <hi>The God of patience and conſolation grant you to be like minded one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. They of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks did intend, in making diviſions and offences, to draw from the divided and offended <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 19. Mark 7. 19</note> earthly things, for cramming with delicates their belly (which is the receptacle of all meats) and for pampering their fleſh, and its other luſts, all which receive from the belly, much of their inflammation: for the belly is a Kitchin cheriſhing, and keeping warme the ſeeds of all manner of carnal luſts: to which (it ſeems) theſe wicked ſeekers to pervert the believing <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 14</note> were addicted, and were reſolved to ſerve their luſts, in ſeeking to be from any ſort or faction of people, provided for their fleſh to fulfil the luſts thereof.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, did deceive the hearts of the ſimple, by good words and faire ſpeeches. They wrought on men, who were unskilful, and unwary, eaſie to be led aſide, ſimple hearts, on men, who were of weak judgements, and ſtrong affections, on theſe they wrought, not by ſound words, convincing them by evidence of truth; but by wooing words, full of flatterings, promiſing them much good, and full of bleſſings, or good wiſhings unto them, if they will take that courſe which they propounded to them; herein dealing with them as ſubtle thieves deal with ſimple travellers; they tell them of a better, pleaſanter, and farre nearer way to their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys end, then that is in which they are paſſing: and they with many ſugred pleaſing words offer themſelves to them, to guide them therein, but they lead them out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon road, to a place fitted for robbing of them; or they ſerve
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119173:42"/> them as Satan did <hi>Evah;</hi> ſhe by his fair flattering, fawning, and ſeemingly well-wiſhing language, was deceived to her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing.</p>
               <p>Such were the men of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. but neither I, nor any other faithful Miniſter of the Goſpel, are in the paths, and ſteps of theſe deceivers: for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their moſt pleaſant and plauſible words tended meerly to work among the people diviſions, and offences: but our words both in comfortings and threatnings (for both we uſe) do all of them in their very tendency ſeek to breed and keep among our people an holy union in heart and affections, and in all <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 15 Heb. 4. 12.</note> holy converſation. Our dividing (as it is our duty) the Word of God aright, doth ſometimes convincingly (through Gods bleſſing) divide ſinners from their ſins, which are offences to God and good men: and ſo prepares them to an amendment, and to a removing of what offends: but our dividing the Word aright, doth not, neither ought it tend to work between peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and people a cauſeleſſe ſeparation and diviſion from one another, either in their affections, or in their Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for it chiefly aimes to teach all, how they (according to Gods will) may with one minde, and with one mouth glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, did not ſerve Chriſt, but their own belly. They did not (as good ſervants would) ſeek to promote his glory, his honour, his Kingdome, and his Word among his people: they ſet not themſelves to teach them the faith of Chriſt, and love to Chriſt, and love to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: nor to acquaint them with the peace of Chriſt, nor to excite them to ſhew forth the vertues of Chriſt, his humility, his patience, his meekneſſe, his wiſdome, and his other imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table excellencies in their lives and converſation: but they ſerved their own bellies; they ſought by cauſing diviſions and offences among people, to fiſh for themſelves in theſe troubled waters; to ſuck out thence no ſmall advantage, towards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for their own eaſe, ſecurity, ſenſuality, and ſatisfying of all their worldly and fleſhly luſts; Whereas I and other faithful Miniſters are no Caterers for worldly and fleſhly luſts, as were theſe Deceivers. We ſerve not our own bellies, but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: for we do not ſeek (as theſe Deluders did) to ſerve our own turns by fomenting diviſions and offences among
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:119173:42"/> others: we affect not invitations unto any mans dainties: God hath given us a nature to be content with a little, and grace to be content with much leſſe then nature craveth. The providing for our fraile bodies things lawful and neceſſary, is not that ſerving of the belly, which the Apoſtle condemneth: neither is it unlawful unto us Miniſters, or to any other rank of men to <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 23</note> provide things neceſſarily ſerviceable for life and health: yet the feeding our own and others bodies, is not made by us our buſineſſe; but the feeding our own and others ſoules, with the word which abides to everlaſting life, is the ſcope and end of our labours in our ſerving Jeſus Chriſt; on this work we attend, and are wholly intent that Chriſt our Maſter may be glorified by our ſervice. The labours of the man of God (ſuch are we Miniſters whom he hath called and imployed in his Miniſtry) is for the mouth, not for the belly: for ſtudy <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 6. 7</note> of holy Scripture, and finding out acceptable words, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our ſelves unto daily attendance upon reading, meditation and doctrine, as that by our mouth and lips we may preach unto people, and teach them the heavenly knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt; and thereby feed many: and though while we live the appetite will not be filled, with ſtudying out more knowledge, in the Myſtery of Chriſt, and with labouring for the good of people, in communicating to them ſuch knowledge; yet as faithful ſervants to our Maſter Chriſt, we do ſeek only the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his glory, and not our own advantages; even by teaching his people how they may proceed in all the wayes of Chriſt, from ſtrength to ſtrength, from faith to faith, from grace to grace, from one degree unto another, we ſerve Jeſus Chriſt and not our ſelves and our bellies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I and other faithful Miniſters do not in our preaching uſe ſuch good words and faire ſpeeches, for which the Apoſtle blames the deceivers of the ſimple <hi>Romanes:</hi> we uſe no words commending and applauding them, no wiſhings of proſperity and ſucceſſe unto them, in their purſuit of things unwarrantable, we uſe no words enticing them to factions and ſeparations, no words promiſing things unperformable; we uſe unto them no flattering words, no ſpeeches which meerly allures the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and doth not informe the underſtanding with the very truth. Our ſpeech and preaching is not with the entiſing words <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119173:43"/> ſpeake not with humane eloquence, which conteineth oft words without matter, but we ſpeak words which the holy Ghoſt teacheth, which are ful of ſubſtance, and evidence of truth: words which are good indeed, becauſe they have God for their Authour, and contein good and wholeſom matters, and they do good to them who are upright, and giveth light and underſtanding <note place="margin">Micah 2. 7. Pſal. 119. 130</note> to the ſimple. I can boldly and truly ſay, I have taught my people (ſince I came among them) nothing but the Word of Truth, which tends to informe their judgements, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their corrupt will and affections, and to conforme their perſons and lives to the holy will of God in all things. I tell thee therefore truly, I am not in the ſteps of them, who with faire ſpeeches and good words, deceive the hearts of the ſimple, which ſerve not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own belly.</p>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:119173:43"/> every man (as he is a man, yea, a creature) ſeeks the good of a being, and of a comfortable well-being, as it is ſuch a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This love is by God ſtampt on every creature, that it ſhould look to its own preſervation, and the maintenance of <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 28. Mat. 19. 19 Luk. 6. 7.</note> it ſelf. It is a law written in nature that the creature ſhould love it ſelf; and the Law of God revealed commands us to love our neighbours as our ſelves: to do to them what we our ſelves would have others do to us, and grace forbids not any to love themſelves with a right love; which is ſuch, when it is a love ſubordinate to that love which we beare to God; we may love our ſelves, but not ſo much as God, nor more then God.</p>
               <p>And thus without any ſinfulneſſe and blameworthineſſe, both I, and thou, and every man elſe, may be lovers of our ſelves; keeping the right order, namely, being willing to reſigne our very being, and all the conducements of our natural well-being, when ever God our gracious Creator, who gave them to us, ſhall remand them from us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is another love of ones ſelf, which is alſo lawful and laudable; it is the ſpiritual love of ones ſelf, when a man loves his ſoul which is his better part, ſo as that he preſers it, and the ſeeking of the good of it before all worldly things <hi>(for</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 26</note> 
                  <hi>what is a man profited to gaine the whole world and loſe his ſoul)</hi> and out of loue to it, he takes care to promote its wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, in all meanes, opportunities and advantages of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it in grace, and fitting it for glory. And thus alſo it is very lawful for me, and thee, and every man elſe, to love our own ſelves, in loving our ſouls, and ſeeking its good, by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of that which is gracious. But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is another love of ones ſelf, which is unlawful and juſtly blamable: It is commonly called the carnal love of ones ſelf; whereby a man eſteeming more of himſelf, and what is his, then he ought, is wholly addicted to regard and follow his own private perſonal concernments, and advantages, with a diſregard of minding, or with a careleſſe neglect of ſeeking the publick good and welfare of others. Such lovers of their own ſelves, were theſe, whom the Apoſtle in the place alledged mentions; and he complaines of ſuch in another Epiſtle: that <hi>they all ſought their own, and not the things of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 21.</note> they ſought their own eaſe, their own profit, their owne
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:119173:44"/> repute, but not the honour of Chriſt, and the publick benefit of his people. <hi>Timothy</hi> was none of theſe ſelf-lovers, he naturally cared for the ſtate of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> he had as it were a parental <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 20.</note> care towards them, as towards children: ſparing no diligence, no thoughts, no pains, though very ſolicitous, in ſeeking after their ſpiritual good.</p>
               <p>I and other faithful Miniſters bear towards our people the like ſolicitouſneſſe, the like carefulneſſe, the like tenderneſſe of affection, the like diligent ſeriouſneſſe of ſeeking their ſpiritual good, as <hi>Timothy</hi> did towards the <hi>Philippians;</hi> and therefore we are no ſuch lovers of our own ſelves, as they were, of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, who would not diſpleaſe nor diſeaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in any thing to promote the publick good of people. We could ſoon ſpare all our paines, labours, thoughts, cares, <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 2 Eccleſ. 12. 12</note> we could quickly eaſe our ſelves from waſting our ſpirits with often preachings, and wearing our fleſh with much ſtudying, and from weakning our ſtrength, with beating of our braines, and with often breakings of our ſleeps, in conſidering how we may to our peoples beſt advantage, ſend out the golden oyle <note place="margin">Zac. 4. 12.</note> of the glad tydings of ſalvation unto them: we could ſpeedily free our ſelves from all this task and toile, which we have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken for our peoples good, if we were ſuch lovers of our own ſelves, who ſeek our own profit, and not theirs. But know thou, that the love we have unto Chriſt our Maſter, doth conſtraine us to feed diligently and carefully his Lambs, and <note place="margin">Ioh. 21. 15 16, 17 Phil. 2. 17.</note> his ſheep; and the abundance of our love, to have the ſouls of his people ſaved, makes us very willing to ſacrifice all our ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, our time, our thoughts, our travels, our healths, our lives, our ſelves upon the ſervice of their faith: we herein ſeek not our own profit, but the profit of many that they may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10 33</note> Therefore I and other faithful Miniſters: are not like one of them, whom <hi>Paul</hi> mentions, who were lovers of their own ſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou further asks:</hi> 
                  <q>Art not thou one that is covetous.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a vertuous and lawful covetouſneſſe; and there is a covetouſneſſe, which is vicious and unlawful: God who knows my heart can teſtifie, that it cannot juſtly account me to be actually guilty in this latter ſort of covetouſneſs: for clearing this conſider.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:119173:44"/> 1. There is a lawful covetouſneſſe, which is an holy affecting and deſiring to have the beſt things, things ſpiritual. This co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe is commended: wherefore neither thou, nor I, nor any man elſe, ſhall be blamed for coveting ſpiritual things: as <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 31 1 Cor. 14. 1.</note> namely to be rich in God, and rich in faith, and rich in good works, ſeeing the Apoſtle bids us to be ſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is an unlawful covetouſneſſe condemned in holy Scripture; It is a mans inordinate affecting and deſiring to have more riches or earthly things then the Lord alots him. It is lawful for a man of a low eſtate, to deſire that it might be better: he <note place="margin">Prov. 30. 8.</note> may pray as holy <hi>Agur</hi> did, <hi>give me neither poverty nor riches, feed me with food convenient for me:</hi> yet ſuch a man is not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, for it is not the bare affecting and deſiring, but the inordinate affecting and deſiring more, which renders a man covetous.</p>
               <p>Now the affecting and deſiring of wealth and earthly things is then inordinate.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When theſe things are in the firſt place deſired and <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 33.</note> ſought, before the Kingdome of God, and the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof. And,</p>
               <p n="2">2. When a man affects and deſires theſe things, with a will, and ſetled purpoſe to be rich, by faire or foule means, by <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 9 10</note> unpreſcribed and unallowed courſes, as well as by thoſe which are approved and appointed. And,</p>
               <p n="3">3. When the affections and deſires to obtaine theſe, are ſo eager, in putting a man upon the looking after them, that he longs to be free, and to ſhift from any duty of piety, equity and charity, which he conceives will let or hinder him, in the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <note place="margin">Amos 8. 5. Prov. 3. 27</note> or in the reteining of theſe things.</p>
               <p>In the old Teſtament he is ſaid to be covetous, who covets <note place="margin">Hab. 2. v. 9 and v. 5. Eccl. 5. 10.</note> covetouſneſſe, that is, whoſe deſires are ſtill enlarged as hell, as death, though the thing deſired be obtained. The New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament deſcribes ſuch men by two words: The one intimates, he is covetous, who from a greedy deſire of having more and <note place="margin">

The other word imports, that he is covetous who is a lover of money; not he who hath it, and receives it, <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119173:45"/> very happineſs to have it: ſuch a man is therefore either ſo didly vile in coming by it: he pierceth himſelf thorough with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 9, 10.</note> ſorrows, and makes uſe thereto of many fooliſh and hurtful luſts: or he is baſely miſerable in hugging and hoard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, though it will ruſt: every penny which he is to part <note place="margin">Jam. 5. 3.</note> with towards any publick good is as a drop of blood diſtilled from his very heart.</p>
               <p>By what is ſaid it may eaſily be conceived what manner of men they were whom the Apoſtle calls covetous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To thy queſtion, which is,</hi>
                  <q> Art not thou one that is covetous?</q>
               </p>
               <p>I plainly anſwer: I am not, I bleſſe me God for it, that <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 5.</note> my converſation in this world, hath been hitherto, without covetouſneſs, without love of money. I can truly ſay as the <note place="margin">Act. 20. 33</note> Apoſtle did, I have coveted no mans ſilver, nor gold, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel: yea, and I can challenge the whole world, as <hi>Samuel</hi> did the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> here I am, witneſs againſt me before the Lord: whoſe Oxe have I taken? or whoſe Aſſe have I taken? ſo I can truly ask, whoſe Sheep, or whoſe Lamb, or whoſe Cow, or whoſe calfe, or whoſe horſe have I taken, or whom have I defrauded, or whom have I oppreſſed? the tythes of theſe things, which I have taken was not mans, but the Lords dues: and according to his preceptive appointing them to his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and his Providential deſigning me to my lot in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry: I have took my ſhare, which by him, and the Laws of the Nation is allowed to me: and it is unjuſt to repute me and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miniſters to be covetous men, becauſe we have took our dues: for we are thankfully content with that which God allots us, ſo are not men who are covetous: and we do not envy at the enjoyments of others, neither do we deſire to ſhare in any part of that allotment which God hath granted unto other men; covetous men are of another tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
               <p>The truth is neither Miniſters, nor any other ſort of men, can juſtly be called lovers of their own ſelves, and covetous, becauſe they demand and take that maintenance which God allots them, which is in the hands or cuſtody of others; who ought not to with-hold the good from them to whom it is <note place="margin">Prov. 2. 33</note>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:119173:45"/> due. Miniſters are not covetous, becauſe they demand and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive tythes, which is their due: neither is the people covetous, becauſe they ask and take from others thoſe debts which are owing and due unto them. Thou haſt then no reaſon to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect me, or any faithful Miniſter to be men covetous, becauſe we take tithes: Lay your hands upon your own hearts, and condemne your ſelves as men extreamly covetous, if ye will envy at that allowance which God hath conſigned to us Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters your fellow ſervants; and if being uncontent with the nine parts in that portion of Gods bleſſing, which he bountifully allots to you, ye will with fraudulent or other unlawful courſes ſeek alſo to bereave his Miniſters of the tenth part of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on your increaſe, which God appoints unto them, ye then diſcover your ſelves to be greedily covetous, in ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up that which is none of yours, ye may perhaps like the wicked, boaſt of having herein your hearts deſire, and bleſſe and applaud your covetous ſelves: but the Lord abhors you for <note place="margin">Pſal. 10. 3.</note> ſuch doings. Briefly ye your ſelves who will keep from us our tythes, and not we who demand them and take but our dues, are the men, who are truly called covetous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the laſt part of thy Querie, which is,</hi>

               <p>I anſwer.

               <p n="1">1. The Apoſtle would have godly Miniſters (ſuch as <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> was) to be turned away from ſuch: to ſhew them no countenance, no liking, that they might ſee in their looks that their evill courſes, hath no roome, no approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in any of theſe good Miniſters hearts; and not only ſo, but</p>

                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:119173:46"/> 2. The words import, that they are to be turned againſt ſuch, both in manifeſting, that their converſation is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the converſation of ſuch evil ones; to which purpoſe the Apoſtle directs Miniſters (in directing <hi>Timothy)</hi> to a <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 10, 11.</note> known practical following of his doctrine, manner of life, purpoſe, faith, love, long-ſuffering, charity, patience, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, afflictions; as alſo they are to be turned againſt ſuch, in having their communication oppoſite to that reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the truth; and to that corruption in life, which Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers deceiving and being deceived, manifeſted. To which purpoſe the Apoſtle exhorts Miniſters (in exhorting <hi>Timothy)</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 14, 15, 16, 17</note> to continue in the things which they had learned and known (as <hi>Timothy</hi> did) out of the holy Scripture: whereby they might be profitable in Doctrine, in Reproofs, in Corrections, in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, in Righteouſneſs, and be perfectly furniſhed unto all good works.</p>
               <p>I am ſuch, even a man profeſſedly oppoſite to men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt mindes, who are reprobate concerning the faith, and who reſiſt the truth. I am a man alſo, whoſe life, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation (through Gods mercy unto me) is not tainted with any of thoſe nineteen odious corruptions, which the Apoſtle menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I am one who endeavours (as <hi>Timothy</hi> is exhorted to do) to war a good warfare, holding faith and a good conſcience, <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 18, 19. 1 Tim. 4. 12</note> and to be an example of believers, in word, in converſation, in charity, in ſpirit, in faith and purity: and I therefore tell thee both truly and plainly: that I am not any ſuch man, from whom thou, or any other, hath any warrant or command from God to turn away.</p>

Laſtly, <hi>Peters</hi> words are not ſpoken of thoſe, who meerly coveting and longing to gain ſouls to God, and to make them Chriſts Diſciples, do plainly let them know, how miſerable, or how comfortable they ſhall be, according as they ſhall reject, or receive and embrace Chriſt, the pearle of the Goſpel, and his precious truths: But they are ſpoken of them, who out of covetous deſires, to raiſe a greater worldly gain, from thoſe whom they intend to make their own Diſciples, do uſe fine, plauſible, alluring words, the better to conceale and cloak thoſe errours and hereſies, which they vent: which being entertained, the ſouls of thoſe, who embrace them, are ſold to become ſlaves, unto ſuch corruptions, that the Devil can lead them captive at his pleaſure.

But bleſſed be God, we who are faithful Miniſters do hate no mans perſon, nor no mans goodneſſe: our deſires are that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, (eſpecially they who belong to our Congregations and Families) did abound in all goodneſſe: and our endeavours are, by teaching in all wiſdome to preſent every man (if it were poſſible) exceeding good, even perfect in Chriſt <note place="margin">Col. 1. 28.</note> Jeſus. I and faithful Miniſters are not in the way of <hi>Caines</hi> cruelty.</p>
               <p>But I will tell thee who are; there is in theſe our dayes, <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 3</note>
               </p>
               <p>A man of ſinne, who is a <hi>Caine</hi> in chief, he is the head of the Papacy, and is called a ſonne of perdition, becauſe he ſhall be deſtroyed by the Lord, and becauſe he breaths out perdition, deſtruction, againſt all true Proteſtants, and Proteſtant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who are the ſervants of the Lord. He hates their perſons with a deadly hatred, becauſe they will neither in their hands, <note place="margin">Rev. 13. 16</note> nor in their foreheads receive his mark; they will neither be ſecret, nor open profeſſed Papiſts. This great Antichriſts agents are inſtruments of cruelty: all of them are wicked <hi>Caines,</hi> plotting and contriving by ſubtilty, and otherwiſe to diſturb and deſtroy Proteſtant Nations; they hope to be <note place="margin">Rev. 17. 6.</note> drunken with the blood of the Saints, and with the blood of the Martyrs of Jeſus: they are very <hi>Caines</hi> in their hating Proteſtants, and their goodneſſe, being exceeding mad againſt them, which keep the commandments of God, and have the <note place="margin">Rev. 12. 17</note> teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Petty heretical Antichriſts ſwarming now adayes in ſeveral Sects, whether they be acted (as ſome ſhrewdly ſuſpect) by the agents for the Papacy, or by their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean ſpirits, theſe alſo may claim kindred in the cruelty of <hi>Cain:</hi> their cauſeleſſe bitter railings againſt all Orthodox Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, eſpecially againſt the Miniſters, who reſiſts their errours, <note place="margin">1 John 3. 15</note> are undeniable Symptomes, that their malicious, raging hearts are full of hatred; and that as (with <hi>Cain)</hi> they have already ſlain them in their heart, ſo if they had power they would actually deſtroy both the livelihoods, and the lives of all right believing Chriſtians, and of all truth teaching Miniſters, who contend for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I and other faithful Miniſters have not gone, neither
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:119173:48"/> yet do go, in the way of <hi>Caines</hi> infidelity: his offering was <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 4.</note> not accepted, becauſe it was an offering without faith: for <hi>Cain</hi> did not believe, that when he was to give an offering unto God, it ſhould be of the beſt: but he thought that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he brought was good enough; and therefore he offered what came to hand. But the ſervice of our Miniſterial labours is a ſervice of faith: we tender to God and his Church no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 13, 14, 15.</note> labours, then what God hath commanded us to give our ſelves wholly unto: therefore we devote to God and Chriſt all our ſtudies, our choiſeſt thoughts, our beſt gifts, our prime parts, our moſt precious time, and our whole ſtrength, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther count we our lives dear to us, ſo we may finiſh our courſe with joy: we are not then in the way of <hi>Caines</hi> infidelity. I ſuppoſe that ſuch men are undoubtedly in this way of <hi>Cain,</hi> who regard not in what manner they performe any ſervice to God: thinking that any tendery of ſervice is good enough, though it be with little reverence, ſmall affection, and ſcant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion: and particularly alſo ſuch men are in this way of <hi>Caine,</hi> who being to pay (according to their duty) their tithes unto God, (which his Miniſters by Gods appointment are to receive) they think any thing may ſerve, and accordingly do pay their tithes and offerings out of the worſt of whatever they have, not conſidering, or not regarding, that ſuch deceivers are dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <note place="margin">Mal. 1. 13, 14</note> curſed by the Lord, whoſe name is dreadful among the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Heathen.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I and other faithful Miniſters are not in any of thoſe particular courſes, in which <hi>Balaam</hi> walked, and for which the holy Scripture condemns him. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. We are no lovers of the wages of unrighteouſneſſe, as <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 15</note> 
                  <hi>Balaam</hi> was. <hi>Balak</hi> ſent for him, promiſing unto him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, and to do whatever he ſaid to him, if he would come <note place="margin">Numb. 22 16, 17.</note> and curſe Gods people. Curſing of Gods people was iniquity, an unrighteous thing: the reward promiſed for doing ſo, was the wages of iniquity, a purchaſe obtained by ſinne. <hi>Balaams</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mumb. 22. 38 Numb. 23 12 Numb. 22. 20 ver. 12. and 32</note> heart was ſo ſet on getting this promiſed reward, the wages of unrighteouſneſſe, that he was of himſelf willing enough to have curſed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> had not God reſtrained him. Yea, he went it ſeems (after God had permitted him to go) with a purpoſe to curſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though God had forbid him; wherefore the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord told him, that his way was perverſe before him.</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:119173:49"/>
               <p> We who are faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, are no lovers of the wages of unrighteouſneſs. Preaching the word of God unto our people is a righteous thing: it is a bleſſed work: it is a means to bring them unto the bleſſing of God here, and hereafter; it is a work which the Lord hath enjoyned us, and tythes are a righteous thing: God himſelf appointed that they ſhould be paid; and he is a God who will not command, neither can do any unrighteous act: he hath given them unto us his Miniſters, as an aſſured comfortable proviſion for us here on earth, that we may attend on his peculiar ſervice without diſtraction: reſerving for us (out of his free mercy) the full recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of our labours in the life to come. We are not therefore in <hi>Balaams</hi> way, of loving the wages of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and of having our hearts bent to curſe the people of the Lord.</p>
               <p>But I will tell thee, who (in theſe our dayes) are in <hi>Balaams</hi> way of curſing Gods people for the wages of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Romiſh</hi> Emiſſaries are in that way: their mouths and pens vent enough of the gall and vinegar of railing and tart ſpeeches againſt the Proteſtant Religion, and its Miniſters, they hope in time to cruſh and crucifie it and them utterly; and theſe for their thus acting, have penſions (the wages of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe) allotted unto them from ſome <hi>Balacks,</hi> or Rulers in <hi>Romiſh Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emiſſaries likewiſe from ſome Sects, are in this way of <hi>Balaam:</hi> they have their tongues ſet on fire of hell: their mouths <note place="margin">Iam. 3. 6. Rom. 3. 13 14</note> are full of bitterneſſe: their throats are an open Sepulchre, breathing out againſt all people and Miniſters, (who diſlike their way and humour) the odious ſtench of unſavoury, rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reviling language; they cenſure, they condemne, they curſe them, they damne them to the pit of hell. It is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conjectured that the ring-leaders, or principal managers of theſe ill manners towards the Miniſters and others, are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly incouraged thereunto, by ſtipends (the right wages of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righeouſneſs) which they receive from ſome <hi>Romiſh Balacks,</hi> or principal ones, who love to ſee a curſed <hi>Babel</hi> or confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be wrought in the reformed Churches, among the people of God. There is a report concerning a chief one, among this railing Sect, that he in <hi>Scotland,</hi> diſtributed money to gaine <note place="margin">G. F. 1657</note> Proſelites to his way: if it were ſo, his money ſure was the wages
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:119173:49"/> of unrighteouſneſſe; and whoſoever took his money, with a reſolution therefore to deſert the holy truth, may well be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to be in the number of thoſe who have forſaken the right way, and are gone aſtray following the way of <hi>Balaam,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 15</note> the ſonne of <hi>Boſom,</hi> who loved the wages of unrighteouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I and other faithful Miniſters of Chriſt are no Counſellors of others to ſin, or to draw others into ſinne: for ſuch an one was <hi>Balaam,</hi> who taught <hi>Balack</hi> to caſt ſtumbling blocks before <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 14</note> the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to eat things ſacrificed to Idols, and commit fornication.

If any be ſcandalized at our preaching, &amp; at our diſpenſing Gods holy Ordinances according to his inſtitution, it is either from their ignorance of the truth, or from miſtakes of truth, or from their ſplenetick malicious ſpirit againſt the truth: but our preaching Gods truths, and diſpenſing Gods Ordinances, ought not to offend: ſeeing it is our duty to do ſo, and it is all good peoples duty, to attend unto the reaping of good, by theſe holy preachings, and diſpenſations; and though ſome cauſeleſly will be offended, and pervert all to their own perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet good hearers and holy livers will learn hereby, both to avoid theſe ſtumbling blocks, which Satan and his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments caſts in their way, to make them ſinfully to fall: and alſo they will thereby learn to live and to do all to the glory of God, and to <hi>give no offence to the</hi> Jews, <hi>nor to the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>nor to the</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Without all controverſie, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> caſts ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocks, to defile mens conſciences, in diſpenſing with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:119173:50"/> in allowing for money all kindes of filthineſſe, in caſting reproach upon the Clergies Matrimony: in ſpeaking contemptibly of a married ſtate: and as <hi>Balaam</hi> received the wages of unrighteouſneſſe; ſo the Pope the hire of an whore, a yearly penſion for permitting ſtews. The Jeſuites (the ſonnes of that Church) are of the right ſtraine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> in ſtirring up Princes, where they are entertained to diſturb and offend people, by caſting ſtumbling blocks, to overthrow their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and livelihoods, and to enſnare them under Antichriſtian ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</p>
               <p>Moreover I need not relate (ſeeing it is well known) that there are at this day many Sectarians, who walk in <hi>Balaams</hi> way, of teaching to caſt ſtumbling blocks to make others ſin. Such are they who decrie the holy Scripture; who reject Chriſts Ordinances; who will have nothing to do with the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which God appointed: who deny the ſeals of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; who contemptuouſly ſpeak of the foundations of piety, equity, and civility; who are oft belching out blaſphemies, and hatching hereſies; who magnifie a Chriſt, which they have phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied, but reject and deny the true Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Sonne of God, who is the Lord: By theſe and other meanes they have laid ſtumbling blocks, to cauſe people fall into Schiſmes, Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme, and all prophaneſſe; they have by theſe, and ſuch like doctrines, and practiſes, emboldned people to commit the ſins of injuriouſneſſe, of licentiouſneſſe, and of high preſumptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They who were wells without water, and clouds carried about with tempeſts, are plainly deſcribed by the Apoſtle <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 1.</note> to be thoſe falſe teachers who bring in damnable hereſies, whom he mentioned in the beginning of the Chapter, and afterward calls them the unjuſt, whom the Lord knew to reſerve to <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 9</note> the day of judgement to be puniſhed, and chiefly he names them.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2.

               <p>The Apoſtle alſo plainly relates the evil conditions of theſe men.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſaith they were preſumptuous, or men of impudent, <note place="margin">ver. 10.</note> daring ſpirits, to undertake enterpriſes, impious, and peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; And</p>

               <p>And having ſpoken of them in this manner, he compares them to waterleſſe Wells, and to unſtable and unſetled clouds, ſaying, <hi>theſe are Wells without water, Clouds are carried with a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest.</hi>

As wells without water deludes the travellers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of finding relief and refreſhment therein; ſo theſe falſe teachers will at length deceive the hopes of their ſeduced followers: who thinking to have from them ſoul-ſaving, and ſoul-ſanctifying inſtructions, will in time finde that they are as empty Wells having nothing in them but the mud, and filth of ſin, defiling and ſoul-damning doctrines and conceptions.

Sometimes they are in one opinion, and ſometimes in another croſſe conceit: they are uſually exerciſed with great conſlicts, from plauſible and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, though polluting and deſtroying doctrines: ſo as they are unreſolved, unto what they ſhould hold reſolutely: try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral wayes, till they be outed of all wayes, and become ſeekers, or rather looſers of themſelves, being herein like thin empty clouds, toſſed with ſeveral windes, divers wayes, which at laſt vapours into nothing.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. A Congregation being in ſome things out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is no good proof, that he who is over it in things ſpiritual <note place="margin">1 Tit. 5.</note> is a Novice. <hi>Titus</hi> was no Novice, though at <hi>Creet,</hi> (where he was ovet the Church of God) there was ſomething not in order: ſo they who are ſet over the flock or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Lord, to take care of the Church, are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (in the Scripture-ſenſe) Novices, becauſe ſome things (it may be) are for preſent out of order, which in time may by their care and contrivance be brought into good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>

                  <hi>Jeſus Chriſt; how that they told you there ſhould be mockers in the laſt time, who ſhould walk after their own ungodly luſts:</hi> theſe be they, who ſeparate themſelves, ſenſual, having not the ſpirit. Therefore thou and others need not ask me, who theſe ſcoffers were, that ſhould come; for ye may eaſily ſatisfie your ſelves from the Apoſtles own words: though men who are ordinary ſcoffers and mockers of other men, are cenſured, complained of, condemned, and threatned in many places of holy Scripture, for their ſcornings and reproachings of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: yet they were another kinde of mockers, and ſcoffers, whom the Apoſtle ſaid ſhould come. They were mockers &amp; ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of the Word of God: they were men contemptuouſly ſlighting its commands, promiſes, reproofs, threats, and Gods holy Meſſengers, his Miniſters, who ſpeak it to his people. <hi>Peter</hi> particularly ſhews that theſe ſcoffingly ask, where is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of his coming: and that they reaſon againſt his coming, and the day of Judgement, as if they would never be. And <hi>Jude</hi> tells us theſe are they that ſeparate themſelves, that is, (appears by conſidering to what the Apoſtle in the 20, and 21. <hi>verſes</hi> exhorts) they ſeparate from truth, from the holy faith once delivered to the Saints, by their taking up, and adhering unto damnable doctrines: and they ſeparate from the holy love of right believing Chriſtians, by breaking off from communion with them, in all thoſe publick duties, whereby they teſtifie and profeſſe, that they have a joint intereſt in the common ſalvation, and have obtained like precious faith. And both <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> tells us that theſe ſcoffers and mockers are <note place="margin">Iude 3. 2 Pet. 2. 1.</note> men, who walk after their own ungodly luſts: they are d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Such mockers and ſcoffers were thoſe Seducers, and falſe Teachers, and their followers, which the Apoſtle ſaid ſhould come: and theſe ſince their firſt riſing, have had their ebbings and flowings, in the ſeveral Ages of the Chriſtian Church, according as it pleaſed the Lord to exerciſe his Church, with greater or leſſer numbers of them: And I believe that the numbers of theſe ſeducing and heretical mockers and ſcoffers of the holy Scripture, and of all perſons, Ordinances, duties, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, inſtructions, directions, comforts and commands commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto us in the holy Scripture, was in no time of the Church, ſo increaſed, as they are in theſe our days: whereby we aſſuredly know, that we are in the laſt days, wherein evil men and ſeducers <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 13</note> ſhall wax worſe and worſe, deceiving and being deceived.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Thou asks further:</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I finde that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude,</hi> do give the name of mockers, and ſcoffers, unto ſuch falſe teachers, whom they foretold ſhould ariſe: and therefore every one may infallibly conclude, that ſuch teachers are without doubt falſe teachers, who are ſuch mockers, as the Apoſtles ſpeaks of, who ſcoffe at holy Scripture, and caſt all reproaches on it, to villifie and nullifie it: yea, and who jeare and gibe at holy Miniſters, for their preachings of the Goſpel of Chriſt, which that word of truth holds out.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rabbies</hi> of the Romiſh Church, and the rabble of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which they of your way heap up to your ſelves, will never free themſelves from that mark given to know falſe teachers by. Whoſoever hath to deale in the contrroverſies of both, muſt be of a ſtupendious inobſervancy, if he eſpies not both of them to be grand mockers and ſcoffers of holy Scripture, and of the holy contents of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The holy Scripture doth not by theſe words, briars, thorns, and thiſtles, particularly, and diſtinctly, decipher out falſe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from other wicked men. It aſcribes them in general to all wicked men, in which number falſe teachers may be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended: but it gives not theſe names, properly and peculiarly
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:119173:54"/> to falſe teachers, as Marks or Characters, whereby they may be known to be no other then falſe teachers. I think there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was not adviſedly asked; are not theſe the marks of falſe teachers, briars, thornes and thiſtles? yet to ſatisfie thee, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that the holy Scripture doth certifie us touching theſe words. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. We are told, that it is a piece of the curſe on the ground <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 17, 18 Iſa. 7. 23, 24 Heb. 6. 7, 8</note> for mans ſinne; that it ſhould bring forth thornes and thiſtles; and that it is threatned as a ſore judgement to a land, that it ſhould become all briars and thornes, and that the earth which bringeth out theſe is nigh unto a curſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The holy Scripture informes us, that the enemies of Gods <note place="margin">Eze. 28. 24</note> people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were pricking briars, and grieving thornes: and that the enemies of Chriſts Church, are all of them <note place="margin">Cant. 2. 2.</note> thornes, ſurrounding her, as pricking and ſtinging thornes do a Lilly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Scripture certifies us, that among Gods own people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there were wicked men of all ranks, which it calls thornes and briars. One Prophet calls the common people <note place="margin">Iſa 9. 18</note> (who were groſly wicked) briars and thornes, as he ſtiles the great ones (who were alſo wicked) the thickets of the forreſt. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>othet Prophet tells us that the great ones, the Princes, and Judges, and great men in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even the very beſt of them were as a briar, the moſt upright ſharper then a thorne hedge. The former Prophet did threaten that their wickedneſs ſhould be <note place="margin">Mic. 7. 3, 4</note> as a fire in a Wood, which ſhould deſtroy the Nation: it ſhould firſt take hold on the briars and thornes, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume all the trees: ſo wickedneſſe ſhould firſt deſtroy the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and meaneſt ſort of wicked people, and after the Grandees, or them of higher rank and reckoning.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The holy Scripture calls thoſe, who rebel againſt the Word of the Lord, ſpoken and taught, by his true Prophets, briars, and thornes, and ſcorpions: and bids his Prophet not to <note place="margin">Ezek. 2. 6</note> be afraid of them, nor of their words.</p>
               <p>Thus wicked men are in Scripture called briars, and thornes, and thiſtles, becauſe their fruits is not good: they choak the <note place="margin">Mat. 13 12 Ezek. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>4. <hi>Thou having ſaid,</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>that the fruits of theſe is mocking, and ſcoffing at honest people: doſt further ask:</hi> Do we we not ſee that theſe fruits proceed from thee?</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Mocking, and ſcoffing, and other ſinnes of wicked men, are fruits, which proceed, from themſelves, but they do not proceed from me, or any other faithful Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They proceed from wicked men themſelves, even from <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 19</note> the corruptions of their own hearts, which are fields fertile in all ſorts of wickedneſſe, but barren in any goodneſſe; and <note place="margin">pro. 24. 30 31 prov. 1. 24, 25</note> they proceed from their own neglects of husbanding aright their hearts; and from their refuſals to have their hearts and lives ordered, and husbanded ſpiritually, by Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commands, and reproofes uttered unto them by his Miniſters. And,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe evils of wicked men doth not proceed from us, who are faithful Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, and who preach Gods Word, to take people off from ſuch vanities and vild converſation: for the Word preached doth good to them who are good, who walk uprightly. The faults of wicked men continuing ſtill in their reproachful courſes, after the Word hath been faithfully diſpenſed to them; are moſt unjuſtly, by thee, and others ſaid to proceed from the preachers of the Word. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> having heard our Saviour preach againſt <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 14</note> ſerving Mammon, derided him: the Evangeliſt doth not (as it ſeeems thou and others of thy way would have done) charge Chriſt, with the deriſion of the Phariſees, as if that their ſin
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:119173:55"/> had proceeded from him: but tells us plainly, that the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees was covetous: it was from the evil in themſelves that they derided him.

Peoples not profiting under the conſtant labours of painful Miniſters, is not the Miniſters, but the peoples own fault. The Prophets of old preached againſt ſinnes, in which the people ſtil continued after their preaching: God blames not his faithful Prophets for the peoples not amending, but onely the people themſelves. <hi>I</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>have ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Aaronical Prieſthood which took tythes is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but the <hi>Melchizedochian</hi> Prieſthood which took tythes, before tythes were took by any of <hi>Aarons</hi> order, and which ſince the change of <hi>Aarons</hi> Prieſthood, doth ſtill continue, that Prieſthood of <hi>Melchizedecks</hi> order is not changed, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides for ever: and to it tythes are due, and at this day, and to the end of the world ought to be paid unto it; for the fuller clearing this, underſtand, that God had but two orders of Prieſts in the world which we read of: the firſt was after the order of <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> who is the firſt Prieſt of the moſt high God mentioned in holy Scripture. This order was for a time diſcontinued: during that time wherein the Jewes was only known to be a viſible Nation upon the Earth, which were Gods people: But this order is now reſtored again by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath broken down the partition wall between Jews and Gentiles, and hath made the Centiles alſo to become obedient to the faith, and to be ſonnes and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the living God. And now Chriſt is a Prieſt after <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedecks</hi> order, continuing for ever. He is confirmed in that Prieſthood by Gods Oath, which is never to be repealed: <hi>For the Lord hath ſworne and will never repent it, thou art a Priest</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 110. 1</note>

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:119173:61"/> due to be duly paid unto this Prieſthood: <hi>He receiveth them</hi>

                  <hi>of whom it is witneſſed that he liveth for ever.</hi> The other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Prieſts which God had was the order of <hi>Levi</hi> or <hi>Aaron,</hi> whoſe Prieſthood was typical, to continue but until Chriſt (unto whom the Prieſthood did properly appertaine) came, and had taken upon him the everlaſting Prieſthood. He was made <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 21.</note> a Prieſt with Oath; whereas the Leviticel Prieſts were made without an Oath: they were many Prieſts, becauſe they were not ſuffered to continue by reaſon of death; but this man (Jeſus Chriſt) becauſe he continueth ever, hath an unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 23, 24</note> Prieſthood. He was made a Prieſt after the power of an endleſſe life; but the Levitical Prieſts was made after the Law of a carnal Commandment: they were made Prieſts by a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 16.</note> Law, which commanded carnal and outward obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations which were not to continue alwayes, but to have an end. Wherefore the Levitical Prieſts were to ceaſe from exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing the Prieſtly office, when Chriſt the true Prieſt ſhould come, and for ever continue to make perfect the faith of Gods people; he being both the <hi>Authour and ſiniſher of their faith;</hi>

               <p>Therefore I ſay, though the Levitical Prieſthood which took tythe, be changed: yet ſeeing there is another Prieſthood af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Melchizedecks</hi> order, now continuing, tythes become payable as they were firſt, to that order of Prieſthood: and they are to be paid unto Chriſt, who is of that order, now a Prieſt for ever: To him tythes are duly to be paid, as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of his Soveraign Prieſthood: and they are received by him, when they are paid (according to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment) <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 13, 14. 1 Cor. 4. 1.</note> for their maintenance, to his Stewards, his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters who ſerve in his ſervice.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtle plainly ſaith: that the Prieſthood being <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 12</note> charged, there is made of neceſſity a change of the Law. The Prieſthood which was changed, was the Levitical Prieſthood: and the Law which with it was changed, was the Law of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:119173:62"/> Ordinances, ritual obſervations or ceremonies, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly concerned that Levitical Prieſthood, and the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Jewiſh ſervice; and as by that Prieſthood which is changed, there was no perfection; ſo that Law of <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 11</note> Ordinances, which is changed (called by the Apoſtle carnal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances) could not make him that did the ſervice perfect, and they were but impoſed, until the time of reformation, <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 9, 10 Heb. 10. 14</note> which Chriſt brought, who is a Prieſt for ever, and by one offering hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified. I ſay therefore that the Law of thoſe Ordinances, which were adminiſtred by the Levitical Prieſthood, and by which the Prieſts of that order were impowered to officiate, or were made Prieſts, is now changed together with that Prieſthood; for Chriſt who is a Prieſt continuing, hath appointed the manner and order of holy adminiſtrations, to be of another kinde, then theſe were, when the Levitical Prieſthood was in requeſt. And likewiſe he hath appointed another manner of admitting thoſe whom he chooſeth to be his Stewards, and in his ſtead to diſpenſe unto his people warrantably the ſpiritual Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, then was the manner of deputing any to the ſervice of the Tabernacles and the Temple, while the Levitical Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: for then ſuch Prieſts were conſecrated by waſhings, anointings, ſacrificing, and purifying of blood, to attend upon the ſervice enjoyned them: whereas Chriſt hath appointed <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2 7 1 Tit. 5. 1 Tim. 4. 14 2 Tim. 3. 17 Eph. 4. 11, 12</note> that by Ordination only, his Miniſters ſhould be authorized to do the work of the Miniſtry: hereby they are put into the Miniſtry, and receive the gift of becoming men of God, to do ſervice for God; and ſo they are by him given to his Church, to be Paſtors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt: hence Gods tythes are deſigned unto them, as mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Gods men, as a recompence for the ſervice which they do for Jeſus Chriſt, who is over all God bleſſed for ever. <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 14</note>

Therefore I anſwer to thy queſtion: Though that command be diſanulled that gave the Levites tythes, yet the Law of tything is not diſanulled, which gave <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> right of tything, and which is given by Chriſt unto us his Miniſters of the Goſpel. We do not take tythes, as the Prieſts of the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> did, in way of holding up the Levitical ſervice, and Prieſthood, both which is aboliſhed: but we take tythes as they are that tribute or portion of the earths increaſe, which
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:119173:63"/> the Lord hath reſerved for himſelf, and given them unto us for our attendance and waiting on the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, to which he hath appointed us.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Thou asks:</hi> 
                  <q>Did <hi>Abraham</hi> pay tythes to <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedeck</hi> of his ſubſtance or of the ſpoile?</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The holy Scripture plainly tells us, that he paid unto him tythes of both.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He paid unto him the tythe of his ſubſtance. <hi>Moſes</hi> in <note place="margin">Gen. 14. 20 Heb. 7. 2.</note> ſaying, that he gave him tythes of all: and the Apoſtle in ſaying, that unto <hi>Melchizedeck Abraham</hi> gave the tenth part of all, do both of them intimate, that there was not any ſubſtantial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, which <hi>Abraham</hi> poſſeſſed, left untithed by <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> the Prieſt of the moſt high God. And,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle alſo in ſaying, that he gave him the tenth of the ſpoile, or out of the ſpoile, doth thereby ſpecifie one <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 4.</note> remarkable event not before known to the world, whence tythes are due to the Prieſthood of <hi>Melchizedecks</hi> order, as oft as ſuch occurrents ſhall come to paſſe: wherefore <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedeck</hi> took from <hi>Abraham</hi> the tythes of ſpoiles; out of which there ought to ariſe an Augmentative benefit to the Prieſt of the high God (Jeſus Chriſt) as oft as victories over enemies are obtained. I ſay therefore that <hi>Abraham</hi> paid unto <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> tythes both of his ſubſtance, and of the ſpoiles. The bleſſing which <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> gave, containes in it the reaſon of paying tythes of both theſe. <hi>Bleſſed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be Abraham of the moſt high God poſſeſſor of heaven and</hi>

Again, <hi>bleſſed</hi> (ſaith <hi>Melchizedeck) be the moſt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 14. 20</note> 
                  <hi>high God, which hath deliver'd thine enemies into thy hand: Abraham</hi> was therefore to pay unto God, the tythes of the ſpoile, as due to him, the giver of victory, the ſubduer of the enemies, and the preſerver of the Conquerour. Holy <hi>Abraham</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:119173:63"/> was by this bleſſing well informed upon what grounds tythes were payable unto God; and therefore he would not on any condition give away Gods portion: wherefore he gave the tenth of the ſpoile, which was Gods due to the Prieſt of the moſt high God: though he would not take the reſidue of the ſpoile or goods which he had got in the warre, when the King <note place="margin">Gen. 14. 21, 22, 23.</note> of <hi>Sodom</hi> would have had him. Again, the expreſſing of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſeemes fully to give a reaſon of his paying tythes of both. He annexeth immediately to the interpretation of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedecks</hi> names, the mentioning that <hi>Abraham</hi> gave a tenth of all as a ſufficient reaſon of <hi>Abrahams</hi> paying tythes of his ſubſtance, and tythes of the ſpoiles. The Apoſtles words are theſe, <hi>To whom Abraham gave a tenth part of all: firſt being by interpretation King of Righteouſneſſe, and after that alſo King</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>of Salem;</hi> which is King of Peace, as if he would have us to conſider, that the tenth part of all is to be given to the God of righteouſneſſe, who exacts nothing from any people but that which is right: and the tenth of ſpoiles alſo, as well as the tenth of ſubſtance, is to be given to the God of peace, who cauſeth all to enjoy peaceably, whatever they do inherit.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Thou asks:</hi> 
                  <q>Did he it ever any more then once?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Abrahams</hi> example of doing it, though we had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation how oft he did it, is binding to all (who are by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion children of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to faith) ſo oft to do it, as they have the ſame grounds for doing it, which <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> once had. As therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> paid unto the Prieſt of the moſt high God the tyth of all his ſubſtance, on this ground: becauſe the Lord was the high Poſſeſſor of heaven and earth, and ſo the giver unto him all his increaſe; even ſo every true believer muſt return to God the tythe of his ſubſtantial increaſe, as oft as the Lord gives unto his ſubſtance an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, <note place="margin">Deut. 14. 22</note> which is yearly, for ſo God hath told him; and ſuch have <hi>Abrahams</hi> example acting herein on this ground, becauſe God was the bleſſer of him, from leaven and on earth in all his particular increaſe; and as <hi>Abraham</hi> paid tythe of the ſpoiles which were took in War, on this ground, becauſe the Lord had preſerved him, and given him the victory over his
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:119173:64"/> enemies; ſo at every time when the Lord ſhall call any true believer, to triumph over his enemies, he ought to return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God the tythe of the ſpoiles taken, as a thankful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, that the Lord was his keeper and deliverer from his enemies, and the ſubduer for him of thoſe, who were riſen up againſt him; and as oft as he doth this, he is in doing ſo an Imitator of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who on the very ſame grounds did pay tythes of all.</p>
               <p>It is not plainly ſaid, how oft he did ſo: becauſe the holy Scripture was not indited to be an hyſtory, either to relate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular act, which was done by theſe holy men, of whom it makes mention; or every particular time of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſelf-ſame holy act for ſubſtance, which it ſaith they did; but Gods intention of recording in holy Scripture any good act which they did (though there be no mention how oft they did it) was for our learning and imitation: that we might tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough patience and comfort of the Scriptures have hope: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 4</note> that we from the good preſidents of any good which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports they did, might learne to be patient or perſeverant in the like well-doing, and might be comforted, ſeeing the holy Scripture commends unto us the good which they have at any time done. And holy Scriptural commendings are vertual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandings of us to practice the ſame good at all times on the ſame grounds which moved them at any time to act it: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apoſtle, <hi>follow</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ever that which is good, and think on theſe things in which there is any praiſe:</hi> as there <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 18</note> is a great deal in the good done by the holy men in Scripture whom the Lord commendeth.</p>
               <p>Beſides, though holy Scripture tells not in plain termes, how oft <hi>Abraham</hi> paid tythes to <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> for the reaſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given: yet there is an expreſſion which ſeems to imply, that it was more then once: for the Apoſtle commands, <hi>not to be ſlothful, but followers of thoſe who through faith and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>

               <p>6. <hi>Thou asks:</hi>

I ſuppoſe it is already very cleare, by what is ſaid, that paying of tythes to Evangelical Miniſters is a ſtanding du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be paid unto them; even as it was but duty in <hi>Abraham</hi> (as it hath been proved) to pay tythes to <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> the Evangelical Prieſt of the moſt high God, who met him not with Altars and ſacrifices, like a Levitical Prieſt, but with bread and wine, as if he had been a Miniſter of the Goſpel. Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tythes is a ſtanding duty, to be diſcharged unto the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel, ſo long as Chriſt imployes them in his ſtead, to do his Evangelical ſervice of bleſſing the people, and of bleſſing God for them, and for their good ſucceſſes, and of ſeeking the welfare of their ſouls and bodies, in teaching them to inherit eternal bleſſings in and thorough him the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is plain, paying of tythes was a ſtanding thing to be done after <hi>Abrahams</hi> time; becauſe <hi>Jacob</hi> who was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi>

               <p n="3">3. Paying of tythes is a ſtanding thing to be done after <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> time: becauſe the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were commanded by God to pay them, and that before the Levitical Prieſthood was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, <hi>Thou ſhall not delay to offer the first or fulneſſe</hi>

               <p n="4">4. The Lord hath made a Law, which he never yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed: whereby it is evident, that paying of tythes is a ſtanding thing to be done after <hi>Abrahams</hi> time.

                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9, 12, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>and they which wait at the Altar are partakers of the Altar? even ſo hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the Goſpel ſhould live of the Goſpel.</hi> It is hence very evident that though that manner of worſhip and ſervice is changed, which was performed by them, who were Miniſters at the Temple, and at the Altar: yet the maintenance which theſe had is continued, and to be continued unto thoſe, who are to tranſact that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worſhip and ſervice of God, which the Goſpel appoints: Therefore the Miniſters of the Goſpel are not to live of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples allowance, but of the things belonging to the Goſpel, which is the tythe eſtabliſhed by a Law which was never yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed: and which by Chriſts Ordinance is yet further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, for as much as it entailes for ever on his Evangelical Miniſterial ſervants the things of this Goſpel, which are the tythes, and which were formerly ſetled on his Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſervants, during the continuance of their ſervice for him.</p>
               <p>And let not cavillers hereafter clamour againſt this proofe for tythes, as taken from the Law: ſeeing the Apoſtle in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the equity of Miniſters maintenance, calls on us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the very voice of the Law enjoyning it. <hi>Say I</hi> (ſaith he) <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 8, 9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>theſe things as a man? or ſaith not the Law the ſame alſo. For it is written in the Law of Moſes, thou ſhall not muzzle the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth out the corne;</hi> or, ſaith he it altogether for our ſakes; for our ſakes no doubt it is written, that he that ploweth ſhall plow in hope, and that he that threſheth in hope ſhould be partaker of his hope. And again, in declaring after what manner the ſetled maintenance of Chriſts Evangelical Miniſterial ſervants ſhould ariſe, he asks us if we do not know (namely, according as the book of the Law hath penned it) how the Levitical Miniſterial ſervants of God had their maintenance ariſe: and intimates plainly, that the Lord hath ordained, that in like manner the Preachers of the Goſpel ſhould live, or have their maintenance. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine writing concerning the ample maintenance, which the laborious Miniſters of the word were to have, he cites for
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:119173:66"/> proof of it the forementioned place out of the Law: as if he <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 17, 18.</note> would have us to underſtand that the limiting Miniſters, and curbing them from enjoyment of their full maintenance, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law: it is a muzzeling the Oxe that treadeth out the corne: and that their having maintenance by tythes, is but what the Law appoints, and the Goſpel ordaines: and that they who will but allow them a charitable, and not an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable maintenance, are tranſgreſſors againſt the Law, which forbids the muzzeling of the Oxe that treadeth out the corne. They then who in the time of the Goſpel, will in no caſe hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the Law of God, whether the New Teſtament directs us, for the finding out the deciſion of this, and ſome other particular points, muſt acknowledge, that either the Apoſtle (who ſends us to conſider what the Law ſaith) was therefore in a foul errour, which none who are true Chriſtians dare do: or that themſelves (who deny to heare what the Law ſaith) are in the errour for want of grace and judgement; and that out of pride and Covetouſneſſe they will not believe the New Teſtament which tell us, that the Law hath determined it. From what I have ſaid, I do punctually anſwer thee, and ſay, that this paying of tythes is a ſtanding thing to be done after <hi>Abrahams</hi> time.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Thou asks.</hi> 
                  <q>Is the Sonne of God become the end of all ſimilitudes and likeneſſes?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> All ſimilitudes and likeneſſes which were appointed by God in the Ceremonial Law, either to prefigure Chriſt who was to come; or to ſhadow out ſomething of the ſpiritual worſhip and glory, which ſhould be in and to the Church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſts coming, and then were to be accompliſhed and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, are all now ended by his coming; they are no longer to continue to that purpoſe for which they formerly ſerved. There is no more need of them, (ſeeing that which was ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and repreſented by them, is come and exhibited) then there is need of a picture, when the perſon, whom it deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, is preſent. The Apoſtle ſaith, that the Law (he is treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 1</note> of the Law Ceremonial, which was the Law of Aaronical ritual Ordinances) had but a ſhadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things. Ceremonial Ordinances <note place="margin">Col. 2. 17.</note>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:119173:66"/> were but the ſhadow of things to come, but the body is Chriſt. Wherefore though I ſay, that Chriſt being come, and having fulfilled all: the uſe which theſe Ceremonial types, patternes, figures, ſhadows, likeneſſes, or ſimilitudes had, is now aboliſhed: they are in reſpect of their former uſe, now by Chriſts coming come unto a perpetual end: yet I affirme, that tythes was none of thoſe ſimilitudes or likeneſſes: for tythes figured nothing in Chriſt, nor in his Church, to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by Chriſt at his coming. The learned wits of the world have not yet deviſed, with any ſucceſſeful proof, what that body is, whereof tythes ſhould be the ſhadow, or what that was which they figured out to be accompliſhed at Chriſts coming. I therefore conclude, that though the Sonne of God is come, the end of all ſimilitudes and likeneſſes: yet becauſe tythes was no ſuch ſimilitude or likeneſſe which he ended: therefore he hath not put a period or end to tythes: Theſe are ſtill perpetually to be continued unto Chriſts eſtabliſhed Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, <note place="margin">Mat. 28. 20</note> throughout the world, ſo long as Chriſt ſhall be with them, which will be even unto the end of the world.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thou ſeems in theſe expreſſions to have this thought: that living of the Goſpel is no more then that a preacher of the Goſpel hath a power to eat and drink what is ſet before him: thou produces for proof hereof, the words of our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, bidding his Diſciples, when he ſent them forth, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:119173:67"/> who was worthy, and eat ſuch things as were ſet before <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 11 Luk. 10. 8</note> them. Thou alſo mentions ſome other things beſide meat and drink whereunto (as thou ſuppoſes) there is no grant to any Preacher of the Goſpel, in the Apoſtles writings, to make claime thereto; and thy promiſe afterward doth plainly ſhew, that thou thinks, that no other livelihood is appointed in holy Scripture, to be given to a preacher of the Goſpel, then a little meate and drink, when he comes to a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy houſe.</p>
               <p>For the rectifying of thy miſ-apprehenſion, I will,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Shew that according to the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> judgement, living of the Goſpel doth entitle the preachers of the Goſpel to more then to a bare power to eat and to drink.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I will ſhew that our Saviours inhibition of his Apoſtles and Diſciples, when he firſt ſent them forth, was no prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Preachers of the Goſpel, and their ſucceſſours to take tythe, or any of thoſe things, which they were forbid at that preſent to take along with them, when they were ſent forth at firſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I will manifeſt, that though the Apoſtle doth not in expreſs words ſay, he had power to take augmentations, &amp;c. yet he ſaith enough, to ſhew that a Miniſter or Preacher of the Goſpel hath a very lawful power to take all theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, living of the Goſpel, according to the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> judgement doth intitle the Preachers of the Goſpel to more then to a bare power to eat and to drink. Three Reaſons cleares this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Apoſtle enjoyns them who are taught to communicate <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 6.</note> to him that teacheth in all good things: Then ſurely teachers, according to <hi>Pauls</hi> judgement, are intituled, to have from thee taught more, and other things then a little meat and drink. Therefore as a Levite of old had power to eat and drink at the houſe of a Jewiſh Profeſſour; and yet had beſides a right to <note place="margin">Deut. 14. 29</note> receive, from ſuch a profeſſour, the tythe of all the increaſe, wherewith God had bleſſed him: even ſo a preacher of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel hath a power to eat and to drink, when he comes to the houſe of a Chriſtian Profeſſour, who is taught by him: and he hath alſo in <hi>Pauls</hi> judgement, a right to partake in all thoſe good things, wherewith God hath increaſingly bleſſed that ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour who is taught.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:119173:67"/> 2. The Apoſtles ſaying that they who labour in the word and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine are to be counted worthy of double honor, doth evidence, that his judgment was, that preachers of the Goſpel are intituled <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 17.</note> to receive more then a little meat &amp; drink from an houſholder, whoſe teachers they are; for they will give as much to very beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers coming to their houſe, whom they little honour or eſteeme. But labourers in the word and doctrine (ſaith the Apoſt.) are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of honour, that is, of maintenance: the reaſon he alledges, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates clearly, that by honor in that place, he underſtood mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; yea, they are (he ſaith) worthy of double honor, that is, of a liberal, honorable, comfortable maintenance, as a juſt and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reward of their labors. Even as the firſt-born while they held the Prieſthood, had a double portion; beſides the portion which they had as other children, they had the tythes as an honorary of their Prieſthood, whereby their portion was double: ſo the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle (it ſeemes alluding to the double portion of the firſt-borne) enjoyns, that the Preachers of the Goſpel have double honour, or honorable maintenance; namely, maintenance both as other men, and alſo a further maintenance, as they are Miniſters of the Lord: and ſo they are to have that very maintenance which the Levites <note place="margin">Num. 3. 35 Numb. 8. 18, 19.</note> had, being aſſumed into the room of the firſt-born, as Prieſts and Miniſters of God, wherby their portion was doubled among their brethren. This double portion, or double honour, or double main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, was in the Apoſtles judgment, due unto the Preachers or Miniſters of the Goſpel. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo far from conceiting, that they who preach the Goſpel had only a title to receive a little meat &amp; drink when they came to a worthy houſe; that counting the Miniſtry of the Goſpel to be a more honourable and glorious <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11</note> Miniſtry, then the Prieſthood of <hi>Levi,</hi> he thought it alſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to have the like, yea, the very ſame portion or maintenance, as a reward of its painful and continued labours, in ſeeking to ſet forth Chriſt crucified, which that Levitical Prieſthood had, while they were exerciſed about beaſts ſacrificed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is certain, that living of the Goſpel intitles the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <note place="margin">2 Cor. 9. 13, 14.</note> of the Goſpel in <hi>Pauls</hi> judgement, to as much, as living of the things of the Temple, and partaking with the Altar, did intitle thoſe, who miniſtred about holy things, and waited at the Altar: Now as all know ſuch had a title to more then a little meat and drink: and therefore the Preachers of the Goſpel have title alſo to more then that; and as the Levites miniſtring about holy things, were intituled to all the Temple <note place="margin">Deut. 18. 1 Numb. 18 21</note> and Altar-maintenance, which was the offerings of the Lord and his inheritance; and his inheritance was the tythes: even ſo
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:119173:68"/> the Preachers of the Goſpel are intituled to all the tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the Goſpel, which the Lord by his Ordinance hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to belong to the Goſpel, for the ſupport of his Goſpel ſervice: and theſe temporalities are the Lords inheritance, which are called tythes; which tythes were formerly granted unto the children of <hi>Levi,</hi> but now are taken from them, and given unto Chriſt, and are ratified to be his Miniſters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the end of the world, for ſo long their Miniſtry muſt laſt.</p>
               <p>Thus thou may rightly apprehend, that according to <hi>Pauls</hi> judgement, the Preachers of the Goſpel are intituled to more then to a bare power to eat and to drink: and likewiſe thou may underſtand what that is, to which their living of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel doth entitle them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, conſider, that our Saviours inhibition of his Apoſtles and Diſciples, when he firſt ſent them forth, was no prohibition of the Preachers of the Goſpel, and their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors to take tythe, or any of thoſe things which they were forbad at that preſent to take along with them, when they were ſent forth at firſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe this command of our Saviour was onely a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar temporary precept unto theſe Apoſtles and Diſciples, to be obſerved by them, during this their firſt ambaſſage, and ſhort journey, into thoſe ſeveral places of <hi>Jewry</hi> whither he ſent them: But it was not a ſtabliſhed precept to be exerciſed by them at all other times, and in that and other countreys and places, whither afterward they ſhould go to preach the Coſpel, Wherefore,</p>
               <p n="2">2. This precept was revoked and repealed by our bleſſed Saviour himſelf, ſaying; <hi>When I ſent you forth without purſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 35</note> 
                  <hi>and ſcrip, and ſhooes, lacked you any thing? and they ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: then ſaid he unto them: but now he that hath a purſe, let him take it, and likewiſe his ſcrip: and he that no ſword, let him ſell his garment and buy one.</hi> They were forbad at firſt, but enjoyned afterward to take theſe. At firſt they were inhibited to take with them a purſe, with gold, ſilver, and braſs, that is, with any money of great or ſmall value, therewith to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh themſelves with back and belly. They alſo were forbad to take a ſcrip, which ſerved (as the cuſtome then was) to put therein corn and other proviſion; yea, and they were not
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:119173:68"/> to take with them a flaffe for their own defence, and for the offence of others; theſe things they then might not take with them, becauſe all theſe things ſhould be provided for them. As it is Gods Ordinance, that they who preach the Goſpel ſhould live of the Goſpel; ſo it was Chriſt who prohibited the firſt preachers of the Goſpel, to provide for themſelves at their own free coſt and charges; aſſuring them, that he that ſet them on his work, would freely and fully provide for them all things, which would be neceſſary, both for procuring, and keeping, and for defending to them a maintenance or liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Our Saviour gives this reaſon of his ſending them out unfurniſhed from themſelves: for the workman is worthy of <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> his meat, that is, of whatever is available towards his nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both by ſuſtenance and by ſupportance. It is plain, that even during the force of that prohibition, that they ſhould not take thoſe things along with them which Chriſt mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: yet they might lawfully take from thoſe, unto whom they preached (whoſe hearts the Lord made willing to give) both gold and ſilver, add braſs, or any ſort of money, and proviſions, and cloaths, and lodgings, which was certainly more, then a little meat and drink, as thou ſuppoſes; and now that former inhibition being repealed, there is a ſtrong injunction, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Miniſters of Chriſt to receive things conducing, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them neceſſaries. They may now receive a purſe with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, of what rate ſoever, whether it be gold, or ſilver, or braſs, or any other. They may receive ſeveral proviſions in plenty, even a ſcrip, the repoſitory, and keeper of proviſion, which is not ſpent in the preſent uſe, but reſerved for future mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and alſo they make uſe of any lawful power of inſtruments of protection: and in caſe they want ſuch, they may lawfully part with ſomething otherwiſe neceſſary, even with their coat, ſo they may thereby procure a ſword, to wit, the ſword of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to defend their perſons and their juſt rights.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, conſider, that though the Apoſtle doth not in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words ſay, that he had power to take Stipends, Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, Tythes, Glebe-lands, great ſummes of money, or Parſonage Houſes: yet he ſaith enough, to ſhew, that his judgement was, that the Miniſters of the Goſpel have a lawful power and right to take all theſe: for he ſaith, <hi>even ſo hath the</hi>

                  <hi>the Goſpel;</hi> the words even ſo, &amp;c. referre to what he had ſaid, namely, they which miniſter about holy things, live of the things of the Temple; and they which wait at the Altar are partakers with the Altar: even ſo the Lord hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that, &amp;c. the meaning is cleare, that the maintenance of them, who preach the Goſpel, ſhould be like the maintenance, which they had, who miniſtred about holy things, and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Altar.

               <p>I anſwer. 1. Chriſt ſent forth firſt the twelve Apoſtles, and after that the ſeventy Diſciples, two and two, upon a ſhort journey to the Towns and Cities of <hi>Judea,</hi> to preach and to work miracles, even in that time, when the publick main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for teaching the people, was not taken from the Prieſts and Levites, and was not ſetled as yet on any Miniſters of the Goſpel: and therefore Chriſts enjoyning theſe, whom he thus ſent forth (in regard that they were but to make a ſhort ſtay any where) to abide till they went thence, in that houſe which they had by enquiry found worthy, or meet, or conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for them to ſojourn in, and there to eat what was ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: I ſay, Chriſts enjoyning them to do thus, is no injunction from Chriſt to any ſetled Miniſter of the Goſpel (who is to attend his flock, over which the holy Ghoſt hath made him overſeer) to go and tarry in ſome worthy, or well famed Inne or Hoſtlery, or other houſe of good report, and there to eat what the good man of the houſe (perhaps

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have already fully proved: that though there were falſe prophets, and falſe Apoſtles (among the Jews) who made a prey upon the people for filthy lucre and covetouſneſſe: and took their money, and did bear rule by their meanes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vined for money, and ſought for their fleece: and though there was carnal covetous Prieſts, who would be hired, to teach falſhood for advantage: againſt whom the true Prophets and Chriſt, and his Apoſtles in their dayes cryed; yet during that time of theſe falſe Prophets, and Apoſtles, and corrupt Prieſts

               <p>
                  <q>If any people had followed the falſe Prophets, and falſe Apoſtles, and Prieſts, that taught for hire, and come to Chriſt from hirelings, are they to maintaine and uphold ſuch, before mentioned: or are they to maintain ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, or Prieſts, in their way? yea or nay? as Preiſts, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and teachers.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If any ſuch ſhould have come to Chriſt from hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges (while he was on the earth) he would not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were come to him, diſcharge them ftom paying thoſe publick dues and rights, which apperteined to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Miniſters of holy things, among them in that Nation: though among ſuch Miniſters alſo, their were ſome, who were corrupt and covetous. My reaſon of this aſſertion is.</p>
               <p>Becauſe though Chriſt commanded ſuch who came to him, not to follow any pernicious practiſe of the publick teachers: <note place="margin">Math. 23. 3</note> yet he never perſwaded any of them, to deteine from thoſe publick Miniſters who were then Preiſtes and Levites) their dues: but he commanded one, who had come to him <hi>viz.</hi> the Leper, whom he had clenſed, to go and ſhew himſelf to the Prieſt, and offer the gift, that Moſes commanded, as <note place="margin">Math. 8. 4.</note> a teſtimony unto them. A part of that maintenance whereby the ſubſiſtence of the Prieſts aroſe, was from offerings; which Chriſt would never have commanded, to have been paied unto the Prieſts (who in his time were very corrupt) if the profeſſing him, or coming to him, had been a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable exemption, of any of his followers, from paying thoſe dutyes, which conduced to the maintenance and uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:119173:72"/> the livelihood of the Prieſts and Levites, who were then the publick ſetled Miniſters of that Nation. I ſay therefore though we read not, that they who came to Chriſt, had any command, to maintaine thoſe falſe teachers, ſeducers, and hirelings, who for filthy lucre, covetouſnes and for hire preyed on people, and ſought to tyrannize over their ſoules and purſes: yet we are ſure, that Chriſt commanded to pay an offering, which was a part of the Prieſts maintenance, unto the Prieſts, who were the ſetled publick Miniſters, to keepe up the holy publick ſervice, and obſervances, which were injoyned that Nation: and he would not ſuffer the leaſt diminution of their maintenance; no not one offering to be withheld from them. For he commanded the Leper to offer his offering, as a teſtimonie unto them: <hi>viz.</hi> that he did not aboliſh the very leaſt parcell of any thing belonging, to their due maintenance, and honour; ſeeing the very comers to him, are commanded by him, to afford unto ſuch, maintenance in their lawfull eſtabliſhed way of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, even as to Prieſts and publick Miniſters and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</p>
               <p>Thou with thoſe of thy way accounts us who are the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Miniſters of Chriſts Goſpell in this Nation, to be falſe Prophets, and falſe Apoſtles, and falſe teachers, and to be very hirelings, and Teachers for meere gaine, and for covetouſnes: becauſe we require from our people, that maintenance by tithes, and otherthings, which from them is due unto us, both by Gods, and the Nation, law: Yee are confident that ye are the only people of his Nations? who are come to Chriſt, and are the true profeſſors of this truths, and yee thinke, that therefore ye have a juſt plea to deteine from us the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dues: asking us,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Whether comers to Chriſt are to maintaine and uphold falſe Ptophets, and falſe Apoſtles, and ſuch like in their way, as Miniſters and Teachers.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have already fully proved, and therefore will now only breifly tell it thee; that the eſtabliſhed faithfull Miniſters of England, are noe falſe Prophets, nor falſe Apoſtles, nor falſe teachers: and that they are no hirelings, nor teachers
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:119173:73"/> for gaine, and for covetouſnes: though they require from their people the maintenance by tithes, and other things, which is by law eſtabliſhed unto them, the publick Miniſters of the Goſpel to this Nation.</p>
               <p>Moreover know, that notwithſtanding the great confidence of thoſe, who are of your way, that ye are the only commers to Chriſt, and profeſſors of his truths in this nation: yet the whole nation (except your ſelves) cannot believe it, becauſe yee with draw, from proffeſſing publickly with the Nation many ſoul-ſaving truths of Chriſt, and from partaking publickly in thoſe his gracious Ordinances, which this Nation hath maintained, and doth yet maintaine publickely, againſt all. Papall and Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Antichriſtians: though they therefore vex and gnaw their tongues.</p>
               <p>Yet more conſider: that it hath been already proved, that ye have no incouragement from Chriſts words on the pretence that ye are commers to Chriſt, to deteine from the eſtabliſhed Miniſters, any portion of that eſtabliſhed maintenance, which ſerves to uphold them in their Miniſteriall way: but that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſts injunction unto the Leper, ye are to pay unto them their dues: becauſe they are the publick Miniſters and Teachers of the Goſpell of Chriſt, to the people of this Nation.</p>
               <p>I yet further would have it well pondered, that none of all thoſe acts, which are here named by thee, which Chriſt hath done or doth give any allowance to any who comes to Chriſt, to deteine the due maintenance by tithes and by other things, from the publick eſtabliſhed Miniſters of the Goſpell: for.</p>

Neither <note place="margin">Luk. 10. 16</note> do theſe words learne of me, allow any of his people, who are his Vines, in his vinyard, or Churnh, to withhold the fruite of temporal maintenance from his Miniſters: ſeeing he <note place="margin">Luk. 10. 7.</note> himſelf hath ſaid, that the labourer is worthy of his hire, and ſeeing it is of Divine appointment that the fruites or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall maintenance, which his Vines yeilds, ſhould be eate, or <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 7</note> ſpent by his Miniſteriall labourers whom he ſent into his Vinyard, to plant, to water, to prune, to underprop, to weed, to dreſſe; and to do what will advantage the ſpiritual good of his Vines, and of his Vinyard.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is true, Chriſt ſaid: <hi>I am the way, and no man cometh to</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Iohn 17. 4.</note> and thus the Miniſters of God and Chriſt working together with them, do work for God and Chriſt, when (according as the holy Scripture doth appoint) they in their places apply themſelves to work their miniſterial work, that Gods people might not receive the grace of God in vain. <note place="margin">2.

               <p n="2">2. One may be truly ſaid to work for another, when the very good of others is the end, for which ſuch work (though injoyned by God to be done) is wrought among them; thus both Magiſtrates and Miniſters do work for thoſe people who are under their charge. Magiſtrates appointed by God to rule people, do work for the people ruled by them, becauſe <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 4</note> the end of their Magiſtratical work is to ſettle and promote the temporall good of thoſe people he is the Miniſter; of God to them for good. And ſo Miniſters of Gods word, appointed by God to diſpence holy things unto the people, over whom they are placed, do worke for thoſe people: becauſe they are <note place="margin">Rom. 13 6.</note> Miniſters of God to them for the ſetting and improving of their ſpirituall good.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is no unrighteous thing in Miniſters to go and take from people that maintenance, (called in ſcripture hire) which God hath appointed ſhould be took, for that work, which he hath ſet them to do among his people, though theſe people never hired
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:119173:76"/> them, nor agreed with them to work that work among them: Three inſtances will clear this.</p>
               <p>The Levites were appointed only by God to their work: and to take tythes of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for their ſervice: but it was no unrighteouſneſs in them (though the people did not hire them) to take that maintenance, becauſe God commanded them to take it of the people: even ſo it is not an unrighteous thing in the Miniſters of the Goſpel (though unhired by the people to their worke) to take from their people that maintenance, which God hath appointed unto them, for the work which they do among them.</p>
               <p>Againe it is certaine: that the people did not hire our bleſſed Saviour to preach unto them, and yet he tooke maintenance <note place="margin">Luk. 8. 2. 3.</note> from many of the people: it is true that that which Chriſt took, was the alms and contribution of his followers, and ſo it was no unrighteous thing in him to take, nor in them to give it: yet it is as true, that as it was no unrighteous thing in the Lord of Preachers to take alms, and contribution from thoſe, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſet him on work; ſo it is no unrighteous thing in the Preachers of the Goſpel to take from people (over whom God hath ſet them to worke) that very maintenance, which God hath appointed ſhould be given by the people unto them in equity, as a juſt recompence of all thoſe labours which God injoyned them to take among his people: though theſe people never agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them to ſet them on work.</p>
               <p>Moreover the Apoſtle proves from the practiſe of Military men, that it is a righteous thing in Miniſters, to take mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from that ſpiritual warfare which they wage; as it is a <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 7.</note> righteous thing in ſouldiers to have their pay of their livelihood from the people for that temporall warre wherein they ſerve: let it therefore be conſidered that as ſouldiers goe not to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare at their own charges, for the Prince or ſtate, which by their Captaines chuſes them to be ſouldiers, and ſets them on work, doth (according to the proportion which they think ſit) injoyne the people, to defray ſuch disburſments for the maintenance of theſe their choſen ſouldiers: yet ſouldiers are not therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, becauſe they demand of people their appointed main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and receive it from them: though the people did not contract with them for their ſervice. Even ſo Miniſters of the Goſpell are ſpirituall ſouldiers under Chriſt, the Captaine
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:119173:77"/> Generall of all ſouls, and they are choſen by him to their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 3. 4. 1. Tim. 1. 18. 2.

They are I ſay hired hereunto by Chriſt, but not in any way of capitulation with Chriſt for this and for that, for though they Preach the Goſpel they have nothing to <note place="margin">1.

Chriſt hath promiſed to them a reward; upon their willingneſs to accept his work and for their faithfulneſs in fulfilling it: and they are humbly and contentedly thankful unto him, for that viſible temporall maintenance which he hath appointed the people profeſſing him, to pay unto his Miniſters: and which maintenance he calls their wages, and their hire, that is, the outward reward of their labour: and they alſo continue in their labours, thankfully expecting to receive from himſelfe (when they ſhall have finiſhed their worke) the inviſible penny <note place="margin">Mat. 20. 2.</note> of glory, which he alſo hath promiſed unto them, which eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reward of all their ſervices they ſhall inherit to together with all their fellow labourers: and then both he that ſoweth, and he <note place="margin">John. 4. 36.</note> that reapeth will rejoyce together,</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In what ſenſe the places of our holy Aſſemblys are truly called Churches, will appeare by what I ſhall deliver at preſent touching the name of Church, know then, that,</p>
               <p>A multitude of believers is called the Church: namely, the Rationall Church, or the congregation of reaſonable creatures, conſpiring together in the profeſſion of the Common faith, and in the practiſe of all things truly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the common ſalvation. Thus the whole company and ſociety of believers throughout the world, agreeing in the Profeſſion of Chriſt, calling on his name, ſubmitting to his Ordinances, holding communion in the ſame faith, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, exerciſe of godlines, and in things of everlaſting ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <note place="margin">Act. 20. 28. 1 Tim. 3 15 Rom. 16. 61</note> is called in holy ſcripture, the Church of God: the Church of the living God: the Church of Chriſt. And thus alſo partiaular Societyes of believers, viſibly dwelling together within certaine convenient limits and bounds, who proſeſſe publickely together the ſame doctrine of faith and love; and ſubmit to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his ordinances; and to partake in theſe holy inſtitutions which he hath appointed: and who do meete as the Lords people publickely to worſhip God and Chriſt, I ſay theſe particular viſible ſocietyes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 1. 1</note> are alſo called the Church. The Apoſtle writes to the Church of the Theſſalonians, in God the father, and in Jeſus Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Again know alſo that the very places of Chriſtian Aſſemblyes, where Chriſtians meete to perform ſolemne ſervice to God and Chriſt, and to injoy holy ordinances, theſe alſo are in holy Scripture ſtiled the Church of God: namely: the Local Church, thus the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the aſſembly of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inthian <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 22</note> church, and abuſes therein, ſaith: have ye not houſes to eate and to drink in? or deſpiſe'ye the Church of God: the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which he puts between theire own houſes (which were places, proper for their own ordinary and Common buſineſſes)
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:119173:80"/> and the place where the Church was publickly aſſembled (which was no mans houſe but a place for the common uſe of the Church in things only ſpiritual) plainely ſhewes that the Apoſtle calls the place of Chriſtians aſſembling, for Chriſtian purpoſes, the Church of God. And he confirmed it, by ſaying afterwards when ye come together to eate, tarry one for another: and if any <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 33, 34.</note> man hunger, let him eat at home: ſo then the very place where the Church Rationall of Gods people publickly meet, is by the Apoſtle called the Church of God: his Locall Church: not mens home, but Gods houſe, of publick worſhiping him, where <note place="margin">Mark. 11. 17</note> ever ſuch a place be in any nation.</p>
               <p>Though thou in deriſion calls the place of our holy Aſſemblys a ſteeple houſe: yet it is our comfort, that the Apoſtle calls it the Church of God: and that God himſelf hath promiſed to come, and meet us, and bleſſe us in it, as he will all his holy people in all other places, where his name is recorded, and <note place="margin">Exod. 20. 24.</note> called his, as namely, Gods houſe, Gods Church and the like: and where his Rationall Church of holy people meet, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him, and to learn to be improved in all his holy wayes and ſervice,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>3. <hi>Queſt.</hi> What ſcripture haſt thou for ſprinkling of Infants?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I will tell thee. 1. What the Scripture holds out touching ſprinkling, as no wayes condemning the uſe of it in baptizing: and then I will, 2. Tell the ſome ſcriptures injoyning the baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Infants.</p>
               <p>Firſt. know that though holy ſcripture requires that in baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſuch an application of wtter unto the party baptized ſhould be made, as may expreſſe repreſentatively or ſignifingly the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Chriſts blood, in waſhing a way ſin: yet ſeing it no where injoynes expreſly, that the manner of that application ſhould be, either by dipping and douſing in agreat quantity of water: or by pouring, or ſprinkling a little water on the party baptized: therfore the Scripture allowes that baptiſme which is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Sprinkling, as well as that baptiſme, which is donne by dipping. I the rather thinke ſo; becauſe the Holy-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:119173:80"/> but he have made choice of the word ſprinkling, to notifiy ſo much. Thus, the ſprinkling of the uncleane with Hyſop, dipt <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 13. 14 Numb. 19 18, 19 Iſa. 52. 15. Heb. 10 22 Heb. 12. 24 1 Pet. 1. 2. 1 Pet. 3. 21</note> in the water of purification, did teſtifiy faith on Chriſts blood, applying that blood for our clenſing. It was prophecyed of Chriſt that he ſhould ſprinkle many nations. we are ſaid, not to have our hearts dipt, but to have them ſprinkled, from an evil conſcience: Chriſts blood is called the blood of ſprinkling, and the ſprinkling of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt is an expreſſion, whereby the Apoſtle intimates our juſtification: whereof baptiſme is the repreſentation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, know that I have theſe ſcriptures warrantiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, and other Miniſters to baptiſe Infants or little Children. <note place="margin">Math. 28. 19 Pſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Our Saviour commandes his Apoſtles to baptiſe all Nations: excepting none of the Nations, no not infants who are (in the Pſalmiſts opinion) a very conſiderable part of them. He having in one Pſalm ſaid: <hi>Praiſe the Lord all ye nations:</hi> in another he doth call on Kings of the earth, and all People, to praiſe God, and he recounts children among the particulars mentioned, both young men, and maidens, old men, and children, let them praiſe the name of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Againe Peter exhorts the Jewes to be baptized: becauſe the promiſe was made to them, and their children, and to all that are a farre of, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call. ſeing then the promiſes of Grace belongs to the infants of believing Parents, therefore according to holy ſcripture they are to be baptiſed.</p>
               <p>Againe the Apoſtle ſaith Jeſus Chriſt was a Miniſter of the Circumciſion, for the truth of God, to confirme the promiſes made unto the fathers, and that the Gentiles might glorify God fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

What Chriſt in diſcharging his miniſtry a-aboliſhed: in the Covenant made with the Fathers, is aboliſhed, but that is ſtill confirmed and to be in uſe, what is therein ſpecified, and was not aboliſhed, either by himſelf, or by any of his Apoſtles.</p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:119173:81"/>
               <p> This ſcripture affords a double proof of the lawfulneſs of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing the Infants of believing Parents. One is from the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of ſigning thoſe, with the ſeale of the Covenant, who where formerly ſigned. The other is from Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand injoyning Baptiſme to be the ſeale of the Covenant; and not exempting from it any Infant of believing Parents.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God at the firſt making of the Covenant commanded that the Children of believing Parents, or Parents in Covenant, ſhould be ſigned with the ſeale of the Covenant: which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was not repealed by Chriſt, the Lord of the houſe which is the Church: but he confirmed the promiſes made to the fathers. and</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt himſelf commanded that Baptiſme ſhould be the ſeale of the Covenant: and Infants (not being exempt by him, from the bond of the Covenant: but being ſuch as he would have brought unto him, and of whom he hath told us, that of ſuch is the Kingdome of God) are therefore to receiue the ſeal of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, appointed by him, which is Baptiſme.

God in theſe <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 1. 2</note> latter dayes hath ceaſed to ſpeake any more as he did of old, to the father by immediate voyces, and other extraordinary wayes: and now he ſpeakes to his people by his Sonne: People are therefore ſaid to be all taught of God, becauſe they <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 45</note> have the doctrine, or teaching of Chriſt, who is God, whoſe doctrine is the Goſpel, or the the ſpell, or ſpeech of God. Now Chriſt the ſon of God, from his word written, by the mouth of all his holy Miniſters in their interprating, and applying his whole revealed will or voyce, touching the wayes of his ſervice, and their ſalvation, doth preach and ſpeake: <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 20,</note> that his people might be built on the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets Jeſus Chriſt being the corner ſtone. And this his preaching by his Miniſters, from and out of his word writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 19.</note> is called a more ſure word of Prophecy: It is a word more ſure for the benefit of the Church, then any immediate voyce whatſoever.</p>

I ſhall not need to repeate my anſwer there given: reade, and ponder on it, for it may give thee ſatisfacton, if thou art not reſolved againſt being ſatisfied.</p>

               <p>That the holy Scripture calls the papall Antichriſt a man of ſin: that is: a man tranſcendently vicious, peerleſly infamous <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 4</note> for all unrighteouſneſs.

                  </gap>all times were preached by ſeveral Hereticks in the Apoſtles days, and afterward, were ſo many ſtanding puddles of falſe Doctrine, which much annoyed the Chriſtian world for ſome ſpace of time. At length Popery prevailing in the Weſterne part of the world, it became as a corrupt Sea, into which moſt of the filthy ſtreames of former hereſies therein did runne, and was received: and they with the additions of peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, poyſoning, popiſh mixtures, do ſlow out againe, as oft as the Papall Antichriſt, and his inſtruments, do thereby hope either to infeſt, or to infect the Evangelicall or reformed Churches.</p>
               <p>I will name only two Doctrines of Chriſt: wherein the Papall Antichiſt, and hereticall Antichriſts have not abode.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a Doctrine of Chriſt, that Chriſts is come in the fleſh The papall Antichriſt and hereticall Antichriſts, do not in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect terms deny it, for both uſe the name of Chriſt in their words, and writings, and ſome of them in words ſay ſo much; yet becauſe the Apoſtle calls them deceivers, (the word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, ſuch who profeſſe the Coſening of others, even while others <note place="margin">2.

                  </note> lookes on them) and Antichriſt who do not confeſſe that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh: therefore it is certaine that though ſome of them profeſſe it, yet both do conſequently deny it in ſome of their tenents.</p>
               <p>The papall Antichriſt and his adherents, acknowledge in word, that Chriſt is come in the fleſh: but while they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:119173:87"/> that the bread and wine in the Lords ſupper is turned into the very body and blood corporall of Chriſt: they thereby af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that Chriſts body is made of bread and wine, and ſo do implicirely deny, that Chriſt is at ſuch a time, come to them in the fleſh untill that very inſtant be come, wherein the Prieſt utters the words of conſecration.</p>
               <p>Some hereticall Antichriſts ſay, that Chriſt is come in the fleſh: but when they are asked, what Chriſt it is, whom they owne or acknowledge in the fleſh? they reply, that it is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but Chriſt in their fleſh, Chriſt in them, diſowning and denying that there is the man Chriſt, who is a man different from other men, and who is the Mediator between God and man, whom God raiſed from the dead, who aſcended into <note place="margin">2 Tim. 25. pag. 5.</note> heaven, and is now ſitting at Gods right hand, making inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for his Church, who ſhall come againe to judge the quick and the dead at the laſt day. This Chriſt they deny, and ſpeak very contemptuouſly of him, and of that body of fleſh, which he had on earth, and hath now in heavenly glory. A printed paper of theirs called, <hi>the ſword of the Lord drawn,</hi> hath this blaſphemous jeering expreſſion, your immagined God beyond the ſtars, and your carnall Chriſt is utterly denyed and teſtified againſt by the light.

Rom. 1 16</note> and are ſufficient to direct, and inform in all things, abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary unto ſalvation: and that God by its precepts doth quicken his people, and that the Goſpell, is the power of God unto ſalvation; Chriſts doctrine doth magnifie the excellency of holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>The Papal Antichriſt, Pope and Popelings deny, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures are ſufficient for edification in things of ſalvation, without traditions, and ſome of them have reviled the holy Scriptures, calling them a <hi>Dead letter;</hi> and blaſphemouſly, the word of the Devill, as Proteſtants (whom they call here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks)

               <p>Some hereticall Antichriſts, Quakers, and others in our dayes ſpeaking from the ſpirit of Antichriſt, have vented the like ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous breath, againſt the holy Scriptures, ſaying, that they are inſufficient for guidance in things belonging unto ſalvation, in compariſon of the light within them, and thoſe Inſpirations and Revelations, which they imagine that they themſelves have. They do not acknowledge, that the holy Scripture are the declaration of Gods minde: but they call them the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints conditions, intimating thereby, that they being not to us of this preſent generation: but that they only concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Saints of former ages: This conceite thwarts the holy Scriptures: yea, and ſome of theſe hereticall Antichriſts, have licked up the Popiſh ſlavering Rhetorick, in calling the holy Scripture a dead letter; and ſome of them have ſaid, that ſome <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 4.</note> pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Moreover ſome of theſe hereticall Antichriſts have ſaid, that it was no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if all the Bibles in <hi>England</hi> were burned: and that it had been better for one (to whom one of them ſpake) if he had never read the Bible.</p>
               <p>It is evident by what is writ, as it might be alſo, if we would in other points parallel the great Antichriſt, and the petty An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts, that they both have tranſgreſſed and have not abode in the doctrine of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Both the Papall Antichriſt, and the hereticall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts are deceivers The Papall Antichriſt comes (ſaith one Apoſtle) with all deceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs in them that periſh, becauſe they received not the love of the truth, <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 9. 10.</note> that they might be ſaved. The hereticall Antichriſts or falſe teachers, bring in privily (ſaid another Apoſtle) damnable hereſies, denying the Lord that bought them, and many ſhall <note place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 1. 2. 3.</note> follow their pernitious wayes, by reaſon of whom the way of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:119173:88"/> truth ſhall be ſpoken evil of, and with fained words they ſhall make merchandiſe of Chriſtians. Both theſe ſorts of Antichriſts are deceivers, and do manifeſt themſelves to be ſo, for they do not hold the forme of ſound words, but do delight purpoſely, and affectedly to uſe cloudy and obſcure expreſſions, thereby to confound the underſtandings of ſimple men, from apprehending aright the truth, yea and their pretendings to extraordinary holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſtrictneſs, in their converſation and religion, beyond truth, is but a crafty deceite under a meer ſhew of religion.</p>
               <p>It were an endleſſe labour to recount all that cunning craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, and thoſe deluding fallacies, and ſubtill wiles, and cheating tricks, for inſnaring ſoules, and all thoſe depths of Satan, which they have uſed for gaining, and for retaining thoſe Proſelites which they have gained. It is enough to know that the Papall Antichriſt, and the Hereticall Antichriſts, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers: becauſe the holy Scripture hath branded them with that name.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, both the Papall Antichriſt, and the Hereticall Antichriſts, have not God, nor Chriſt, both theſe ſorts of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts do pharaſaically and arrogantly appropriate only to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 9.</note> and their followers, the name of the Church of holy ones, yet both are in reallity no other, then of the ſynagogue of Satan. Their tranſgreſſing, and renouncing, through their Apoſtacy, the doctrine of Chriſt, is a ſufficient evidence, that they have not God and Chriſt in communion: neither have they their favour in this world, and without repentance, they ſhall <note place="margin">2 Theſ. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Fiftly, As they have not God, nor Chriſt in Communion: ſo believers are not to hold communion, or any intimate converſation with any of them.

They are not to afford any intertainment, or incouragement to any Antichriſt what ever; not entertainment?

               <p>All this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> true of thoſe, who are indeed and truth the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt Papal, and his pertinacious adherents, and who are the Hereticall Antichriſt, and their perverſe followers, both which doe reſiſt the truth, and oppoſe the Doctrines of Jeſus Chriſt. But not one word of all that ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall deſcription of Antichriſt, and of Antichriſts, is juſtly appliable to any fathfull Miniſter of Chriſt who both teaches, and abides in all Chriſts Doctrines: as hath been abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proved by me, in this treatiſe: and by ſundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faithfull ſervants of Chriſt, in their ſeverall labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious workes, and writings, for the benefit of the whole Church.</p>
               <p>I do ſomewhat wonder, to what purpoſe, this queſtion touching Antichriſt was propoſed, for if he belongs to the Papall Antichriſt, who contrived theſe queſtions, to get thereunto from me an anſwer; then I dare boldly thinke, that he is ſome puny Antichriſtian Emiſſary, and ill adviſed, if he hoped thereby to gravell, any faithfull Miniſter of the Goſpell, in any of the reformed Churches; becauſe much lea neder heads in the Papacy, then his own, have found ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally that their ſtirring in this queſtion, hath ever been to the great diſadvantage of their <hi>Roman</hi> cauſe, and to the better inabling of the meaneſt Evangelicall Miniſters, to underſtand more clearly that the Head of the Papacy is that Idol ſhepherd, the great Antichriſt, againſt whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
